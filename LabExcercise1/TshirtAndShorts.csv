    Depends on how you like your fit, I prefer a bit of a looser fit so for myself I would size up but they fit my brother perfectly and he prefers the tighter muscle fit, they look great and are of great quality, assuming they are fake boss, you couldn't tell as they match his tracksuit perfectly.

    I know they are meant to be for lounge wear but the sizes are ridiculous. I am medium/large and even the XL was not fitting and the sleeves are too big. Also I am a bit conscious about the authenticity of the product. The box seemed like it was opened and used. Returned both item.

    Bought my usual regular fit mens xl sizing by Hugo Boss. These tshirts however, are cut just too tight. In comparison to the regular fit xl Hugo Boss clothes that I actually own, I would say these are coming in at a large or medium size, or an xl slim fit. Crewneck is cut too large also. Given them to my teenage son

    I know they were cheap (for Boss branded shirts) but they’re not very nice either. Very strange neck (very low for a crew-neck) and very baggy sleeves. I imagined they would look ok on their own, but not at all to my taste. Purely useful as underwear I think, so even cheaper alternatives would do that job equally well. On the white version even the tacky size stencil shows through to the outside.Not impressed.

    I bought these on sale and they fit as expected.However, the material is much finer than I had anticipated (I now notice this is mentioned in other reviews). On the plus side, they wash well so if you are OK with finer material then they may be worth purchasing.

    Ordered size L but had to return as to small and wrong colours from advertised. These are a small fit so purchased XL.Sadly the wrong colours arrived again from the one ordered. I kept them as I needed them for my hols.Amazon really do need to sort this out as it can’t be a mistake and must be and issue at there end with the colours being given the wrong order numbers from the ones advertised.

    I bought these XXL T shirts for my husband to wear in bed as he has MND and needs clothes in bed to be roomy.  These are really excellent value.  I feel sure if you needed a T shirt to wear for work or the gym then these  would be perfect.  They are pure cotton and not at all 'thin'.  My only complaint would be they took about a week to arrive, then I am used to Amazon Prime and there has been Christmas and New Year Bank holidays so no real worries.

    I recently purchased Fruit of the Loom black t-shirts, and they have been quite satisfying. The ease of use is great; they are perfect for everyday wear and layering. The appearance is clean and classic, which is exactly what I was looking for in a basic black tee.The material is comfortable, but I wish it was a tad thicker for added durability. The stitching quality is good, and I haven't had any issues with unraveling seams. As for the fit, it's mostly true to size, although I found them to be slightly roomier than expected. Overall, these t-shirts are a solid choice for your wardrobe, offering good value for the price.

    Most fruit of the loom products are the same and this one is no exception - no problems with colour, thickness of material, or the feel of the material at all. The only issue is washability - you may find that the material shrinks slightly, which may be a problem for some and hence a reason to order a size larger. Overall though, I would recommend!

    For the price of under a tenner each, I wasn't expecting much at all and half expected a return would be in order.But Amazon deliver once again! Speedy next day delivery to the Isle of Bute and the shirts are absolutely amazing. Just what I needed. A couple of nice summery short sleeved shirts and not the boring check pattern that most 50yr olds wear ad nauseum.The shirts are well made with excellent pattern and colour. The size is perfect for me. I am a 48"" chest with 40"" waist and I ordered the XXL. When I first put it on, I though it was going to be far too large but once I had the buttons done up and the shirt tucked in, it was a perfect fit.  Not baggy and with enough room for comfort when sitting down, without being tight across the chest or belly.Highly recommended- Buy with confidence.I do not receive any payment or free goods for writing these reviews. I am just happy to share my views on my purchases with fellow like minded Amazonians in the hope that you may find it helpful.

    I chose this shirt initially for the colour and I'm pleased with that. However I find that it is also well cut with no parts too tight, no itchy seams etc. I followed the measurement guide and am happy with the result too. The material is comfortable in the very hot weather that has just arrived and the stitching is nice. I find that the shirt was made in Bangladesh and I hope it has been ethically sourced, though I have no way of knowing. Having just worn it for the first time I can't say anything about what might happen after washing: fingers crossed.

    I like these t-shirts, they are decent quality cotton and for a chubby guy like me they have a decent length that fits over my midriff. I have a few of them and my only criticism of the product/seller is that more popular colours like black and white are never in stock. They are very good value for the money.Unfortunately, the last one was delivered on a Sunday when I wasn't at home. It would have fitted through my letterbox, instead the driver left it on my doorstep. Amazingly, it was still there when I returned home 24 hours later, but it was a real advert for any local burglars that I was away from home.

    Being some 6ft tall it always seemed that normal XL T-shirts were cut for obese midgets. This one actually fits and does not shrink lengthwise in the wash. Six months on and many washes later it is still going strong. Same for the other colours.

    Great fit, I am broad chested but have a bit of a beer gut. This top is not tight over my belly and the longer fit is slimming if that is what you are after.Worth the price for a comfortable and quick drying sports shirt.

    Nice top . But the size XL was too tight fitting compared to XL in adidas and wrangler that are loose and slightly baggy . If a size chart with other brand sizes as comparison I'd of gone a size or 2 sizes larger instead of XL being a very tight fit .I wonder if retailers will say what size in other brands you need to get a few sizes higher in this brand .simple problem solved

    Really quick delivery. A great quality top and the colour is really vibrant, which I wanted. Other yellow tops have been dull and disappointing.As others have commented the top does come up slightly smaller than anticipated but that is due to the top being quite square and so a little tighter around the shoulders and back. So re-ordered a XL and fits perfect.

    I usually don’t like to rate something so quick but here I wanna rate two things, service and quality. Service because is the first time using try 7 days before buying from Amazon what I can see is an excellent service in my opinion that before purchasing we can than try it and yes after paying for it, anyway I know that even if it wouldn’t fit or something it would be wrong we could than send it back and get the refund but somehow is the process of refunding, etc. In terms of the T-shirt itself, I am amazed and not like what a lot of people says in some reviews, quality not good, fake, etc. For sure this is genuine and top quality, thicker than I actually thought what is great, I did purchase a Hugo Boss T-shirt last year not on Amazon but I paid almost 3 times of what I paid for this one and is soooooo thin, a bit disappointing but I did loved the T-shirt so I kept it. I love Tommy Hilfiger clothes, I have few and to be honest never got disappointed. As you can see in the images, it looks a very good fabric (organic cotton) and fits perfect. Love it 😊

    Received the item (wrong size was sent but that's human error more than anything), as a product it feels a really good quality but the page description states that it is a regular fit when in fact it is a slim fit, so basically requires buying a size two up from normal.

    Not the thickest fabric and sizing a little weird. I'd normally take a 2XL but the sizing chart led me to go for the 3XL Plus. The fit is pretty good, with the sleeves just a tad lengthy. The garment would benefit from a bit more structure in the collar and cuffs, but I'd say it represents good value for the price paid.

    I recently purchased a men's t-shirt that boasted a fantastic fit and a stylish appearance. While the shirt looked great and hugged the body in all the right places, the overall experience was slightly marred by the feel of the material.Fit and Style: 4.5/5The fit of the t-shirt was spot-on, providing a flattering silhouette without being too tight or overly loose. The design and cut were modern, contributing to an overall appealing look. It's a shirt that I feel confident wearing for various occasions.Material: 3/5Unfortunately, the material used for the t-shirt left something to be desired. While it looked good on the outside, the feel of the fabric against the skin was a bit disappointing. It gave off a somewhat cheap sensation, and the texture was not as smooth or soft as I would have preferred. It's not uncomfortable, but it does lack the premium feel that I typically associate with higher-quality shirts.Durability: 4/5On a positive note, the t-shirt has held up well through a few washes without significant signs of wear or shrinkage. The color has remained vibrant, and the stitching appears to be sturdy, contributing to a reasonably durable product.Overall Impression:In conclusion, this men's t-shirt strikes a good balance between fit and style, making it a visually pleasing addition to the wardrobe. However, the underwhelming feel of the material slightly diminishes the overall satisfaction. If you prioritize comfort over aesthetics, you might want to explore other options. For those more focused on the look, this t-shirt could still be a viable choice, especially given its affordable price point.

    Not bad but not great. I have a similar shirt from H&M that's made from nicer fabric and fits a lot better. Can't return it either so a waste of money.

    These are small made. I'm normally a Large and I ordered an XL due to Amazon's recommendation but the XL is still ever so slightly tight.

    Nice bit of clothe, surprisingly good quality for a tenner. I bought a large and ended up giving it to my Action Man and it's a bit tight on him too!By a size larger, or have the best dress military action figure with eagle eyes of all your mates.

    I bought large for my husband and they fitted perfectly,  so I would recommend going up a size, as medium is his usual size.

    The fit was a little small, but the design and pattern is great. For the price, very good value for money. Washes well, which is always a good indicator of quality.

    Black Tees are great but the Blue are a totally different material, they are so much thinner.The first wear of the blue is good but they go misshapen very quickly and look bad after the first wash.The black ones are very good quality and hold their shape well.------------------------------The above review was for shirts bought in the last two years 2020-2022, the black one's were great and worth the money. I got a blue one and it was very thin. I have since got a new black one (2023) and it's the same as the blue one extremely thin. Shame these were my go to t-shirt. Can't recommend them anymore.

    I am 5ft 11, and 84kg. I wear 32inch waist for jeans. I have a long torso and find buying t-shirts can be awkward online as I float between a M and L. I ordered this in Large and it finds perfectly. Long in the torso and not baggy on the arms.

    Really like these t-shirts, the quality of the material is better than most t-shirts on the market. Only issue I had was the under the arm on one side of the t-shirt the seam was coming away showing a small hole. I was going to send it back but sowing session resolved the issue.
