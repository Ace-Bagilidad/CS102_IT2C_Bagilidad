This problem is more severe in mobile manipulation, where collecting demonstrations is harder than in stationary manipulation due to the lack of available and easy-to-use teleoperation interfaces. In this work, we demonstrate TeleMoMa, a general and modular interface for whole-body teleoperation of mobile manipulators. TeleMoMa unifies multiple human interfaces including RGB and depth cameras, virtual reality controllers, keyboard, joysticks, etc., and any combination thereof. In its more accessible version, TeleMoMa works using simply vision (e.g., an RGB-D camera), lowering the entry bar for humans to provide mobile manipulation demonstrations. We demonstrate the versatility of TeleMoMa by teleoperating several existing mobile manipulators - PAL Tiago++, Toyota HSR, and Fetch - in simulation and the real world. We demonstrate the quality of the demonstrations collected with TeleMoMa by training imitation learning policies for mobile manipulation tasks involving synchronized whole-body motion. Finally, we also show that TeleMoMa's teleoperation channel enables teleoperation on site, looking at the robot, or remote, sending commands and observations through a computer network, and perform user studies to evaluate how easy it is for novice users to learn to collect demonstrations with different combinations of human interfaces enabled by our system. We hope TeleMoMa becomes a helpful tool for the community enabling researchers to collect whole-body mobile manipulation demonstrations.

"2","Exploring Safety Generalization Challenges of Large Language Models via Code","Qibing Ren, Chang Gao, Jing Shao, Junchi Yan, Xin Tan, Wai Lam, Lizhuang Ma","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about remarkable capabilities in natural language processing but also raised concerns about their potential misuse. While strategies like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback have enhanced their safety, these methods primarily focus on natural languages, which may not generalize to other domains. This paper introduces CodeAttack, a framework that transforms natural language inputs into code inputs, presenting a novel environment for testing the safety generalization of LLMs. Our comprehensive studies on state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-2, and Llama-2 series reveal a common safety vulnerability of these models against code input: CodeAttack consistently bypasses the safety guardrails of all models more than 80\% of the time. Furthermore, we find that a larger distribution gap between CodeAttack and natural language leads to weaker safety generalization, such as encoding natural language input with data structures or using less popular programming languages. These findings highlight new safety risks in the code domain and the need for more robust safety alignment algorithms to match the code capabilities of LLMs.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:55:38 UTC (8,284 KB)"
"3","Low coordinate degree algorithms I: Universality of computational thresholds for hypothesis testing","Dmitriy Kunisky","Statistics Theory (math.ST)","We study when low coordinate degree functions (LCDF) -- linear combinations of functions depending on small subsets of entries of a vector -- can hypothesis test between high-dimensional probability measures. These functions are a generalization, proposed in Hopkins' 2018 thesis but seldom studied since, of low degree polynomials (LDP), a class widely used in recent literature as a proxy for all efficient algorithms for tasks in statistics and optimization. Instead of the orthogonal polynomial decompositions used in LDP calculations, our analysis of LCDF is based on the Efron-Stein or ANOVA decomposition, making it much more broadly applicable. By way of illustration, we prove channel universality for the success of LCDF in testing for the presence of sufficiently ""dilute"" random signals through noisy channels: the efficacy of LCDF depends on the channel only through the scalar Fisher information for a class of channels including nearly arbitrary additive i.i.d. noise and nearly arbitrary exponential families. As applications, we extend lower bounds against LDP for spiked matrix and tensor models under additive Gaussian noise to lower bounds against LCDF under general noisy channels. We also give a simple and unified treatment of the effect of censoring models by erasing observations at random and of quantizing models by taking the sign of the observations. These results are the first computational lower bounds against any large class of algorithms for all of these models when the channel is not one of a few special cases, and thereby give the first substantial evidence for the universality of several statistical-to-computational gaps.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:52:35 UTC (56 KB)"
"4","Fairness Feedback Loops: Training on Synthetic Data Amplifies Bias","Sierra Wyllie, Ilia Shumailov, Nicolas Papernot","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Model-induced distribution shifts (MIDS) occur as previous model outputs pollute new model training sets over generations of models. This is known as model collapse in the case of generative models, and performative prediction or unfairness feedback loops for supervised models. When a model induces a distribution shift, it also encodes its mistakes, biases, and unfairnesses into the ground truth of its data ecosystem. We introduce a framework that allows us to track multiple MIDS over many generations, finding that they can lead to loss in performance, fairness, and minoritized group representation, even in initially unbiased datasets. Despite these negative consequences, we identify how models might be used for positive, intentional, interventions in their data ecosystems, providing redress for historical discrimination through a framework called algorithmic reparation (AR). We simulate AR interventions by curating representative training batches for stochastic gradient descent to demonstrate how AR can improve upon the unfairnesses of models and data ecosystems subject to other MIDS. Our work takes an important step towards identifying, mitigating, and taking accountability for the unfair feedback loops enabled by the idea that ML systems are inherently neutral and objective.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:48:08 UTC (7,136 KB)"

We introduce the application of Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) to this critical healthcare challenge, showcasing an enhancement in diagnostic performance over the classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach. Our study not only outlines the remarkable improvements in diagnostic performance made by QSVM over the classic SVM technique, but it delves into the advancements brought about by the quantum feature map architecture, which has been carefully identified and evaluated, ensuring it aligns seamlessly with the unique characteristics of our prostate cancer dataset. This architecture succeded in creating a distinct feature space, enabling the detection of complex, non-linear patterns in the data. The findings reveal not only a comparable accuracy with classical SVM ($92\%$) but also a $7.14\%$ increase in sensitivity and a notably high F1-Score ($93.33\%$). This study's important combination of quantum computing in medical diagnostics marks a pivotal step forward in cancer detection, offering promising implications for the future of healthcare technology.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:46:38 UTC (453 KB)"
"6","Distilling the Knowledge in Data Pruning","Emanuel Ben-Baruch, Adam Botach, Igor Kviatkovsky, Manoj Aggarwal, Gérard Medioni","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","With the increasing size of datasets used for training neural networks, data pruning becomes an attractive field of research. However, most current data pruning algorithms are limited in their ability to preserve accuracy compared to models trained on the full data, especially in high pruning regimes. In this paper we explore the application of data pruning while incorporating knowledge distillation (KD) when training on a pruned subset. That is, rather than relying solely on ground-truth labels, we also use the soft predictions from a teacher network pre-trained on the complete data. By integrating KD into training, we demonstrate significant improvement across datasets, pruning methods, and on all pruning fractions. We first establish a theoretical motivation for employing self-distillation to improve training on pruned data. Then, we empirically make a compelling and highly practical observation: using KD, simple random pruning is comparable or superior to sophisticated pruning methods across all pruning regimes. On ImageNet for example, we achieve superior accuracy despite training on a random subset of only 50% of the data. Additionally, we demonstrate a crucial connection between the pruning factor and the optimal knowledge distillation weight. This helps mitigate the impact of samples with noisy labels and low-quality images retained by typical pruning algorithms. Finally, we make an intriguing observation: when using lower pruning fractions, larger teachers lead to accuracy degradation, while surprisingly, employing teachers with a smaller capacity than the student's may improve results. Our code will be made available.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:44:45 UTC (2,030 KB)"

Classical backpropagation-based learning and its variants are often unsuitable for battery-powered, memory-constrained systems at the extreme edge. In this work, we introduce Online Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (O-FSCIL), based on a lightweight model consisting of a pretrained and metalearned feature extractor and an expandable explicit memory storing the class prototypes. The architecture is pretrained with a novel feature orthogonality regularization and metalearned with a multi-margin loss. For learning a new class, our approach extends the explicit memory with novel class prototypes, while the remaining architecture is kept frozen. This allows learning previously unseen classes based on only a few examples with one single pass (hence online). O-FSCIL obtains an average accuracy of 68.62% on the FSCIL CIFAR100 benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art results. Tailored for ultra-low-power platforms, we implement O-FSCIL on the 60 mW GAP9 microcontroller, demonstrating online learning capabilities within just 12 mJ per new class.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:43:20 UTC (245 KB)"
"8","Iterative Graph Neural Network Enhancement via Frequent Subgraph Mining of Explanations","Harish G. Naik, Jan Polster, Raj Shekhar, Tamás Horváth, György Turán","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","We formulate an XAI-based model improvement approach for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for node classification, called Explanation Enhanced Graph Learning (EEGL). The goal is to improve predictive performance of GNN using explanations. EEGL is an iterative self-improving algorithm, which starts with a learned ""vanilla"" GNN, and repeatedly uses frequent subgraph mining to find relevant patterns in explanation subgraphs. These patterns are then filtered further to obtain application-dependent features corresponding to the presence of certain subgraphs in the node neighborhoods. Giving an application-dependent algorithm for such a subgraph-based extension of the Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) algorithm has previously been posed as an open problem. We present experimental evidence, with synthetic and real-world data, which show that EEGL outperforms related approaches in predictive performance and that it has a node-distinguishing power beyond that of vanilla GNNs. We also analyze EEGL's training dynamics.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:41:27 UTC (2,178 KB)"

Extending the equilibrium ensemble yields any given observable as an explicit hyper-density functional. Associated local fluctuation profiles follow from an exact hyper-Ornstein-Zernike equation. Simulation-based supervised machine learning trains neural networks that act as hyper-direct correlation functionals which facilitate efficient and accurate predictions. We exemplify the approach for the cluster statistics of hard rods and square well particles. The theory provides access to complex order parameters, as is impossible in standard density functional theory.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:37:41 UTC (266 KB)"

Chen","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Synthetic data from generative models emerges as the privacy-preserving data-sharing solution. Such a synthetic data set shall resemble the original data without revealing identifiable private information. The backbone technology of tabular synthesizers is rooted in image generative models, ranging from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to recent diffusion models. Recent prior work sheds light on the utility-privacy tradeoff on tabular data, revealing and quantifying privacy risks on synthetic data. We first conduct an exhaustive empirical analysis, highlighting the utility-privacy tradeoff of five state-of-the-art tabular synthesizers, against eight privacy attacks, with a special focus on membership inference attacks. Motivated by the observation of high data quality but also high privacy risk in tabular diffusion, we propose DP-TLDM, Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model, which is composed of an autoencoder network to encode the tabular data and a latent diffusion model to synthesize the latent tables. Following the emerging f-DP framework, we apply DP-SGD to train the auto-encoder in combination with batch clipping and use the separation value as the privacy metric to better capture the privacy gain from DP algorithms. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that DP-TLDM is capable of achieving a meaningful theoretical privacy guarantee while also significantly enhancing the utility of synthetic data. Specifically, compared to other DP-protected tabular generative models, DP-TLDM improves the synthetic quality by an average of 35% in data resemblance, 15% in the utility for downstream tasks, and 50% in data discriminability, all while preserving a comparable level of privacy risk.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:27:49 UTC (15,834 KB)"

In this paper a Multi-center Privacy Computing framework with Predictions Aggregation (MPCPA) based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is proposed, in which conditional diffusion model training, DDPM data generation, a classifier, and strategy of prediction aggregation are included. Compared to federated learning, this framework necessitates fewer communications and leverages high-quality generated data to support robust privacy computing. Experimental validation across multiple datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms classic federated learning and approaches the performance of centralized learning with original data. Moreover, our approach demonstrates robust security, effectively addressing challenges such as image memorization and membership inference attacks. Our experiments underscore the efficacy of the proposed framework in the realm of privacy computing, with the code set to be released soon.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:21:46 UTC (6,274 KB)"

Eye tracking, a technology that monitors and records the movement of the eyes, provides valuable insights into human visual attention patterns. This technology can transform how healthcare professionals and medical specialists engage with and analyze diagnostic images, offering a more insightful and efficient approach to medical diagnostics. Hence, extracting meaningful features and insights from medical images by leveraging eye-gaze data improves our understanding of how radiologists and other medical experts monitor, interpret, and understand images for diagnostic purposes. Eye-tracking data, with intricate human visual attention patterns embedded, provides a bridge to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) development and human cognition.

However, autoencoders, like all artificial neural networks, are often unidentifiable and uninterpretable. This research focuses on creating an identifiable and interpretable autoencoder that can be used to meld and combine climate data products. The proposed autoencoder utilizes a Bayesian statistical framework, allowing for probabilistic interpretations while also varying spatially to capture useful spatial patterns across the various data products. Constraints are placed on the autoencoder as it learns patterns in the data, creating an interpretable consensus that includes the important features from each input. We demonstrate the utility of the autoencoder by combining information from multiple precipitation products in High Mountain Asia.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 17:03:07 UTC (8,217 KB)"

Reader (1), Andrew P. King (1) ((1) King's College London)","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Echocardiography (echo) is the first imaging modality used when assessing cardiac function. The measurement of functional biomarkers from echo relies upon the segmentation of cardiac structures and deep learning models have been proposed to automate the segmentation process. However, in order to translate these tools to widespread clinical use it is important that the segmentation models are robust to a wide variety of images (e.g. acquired from different scanners, by operators with different levels of expertise etc.). To achieve this level of robustness it is necessary that the models are trained with multiple diverse datasets. A significant challenge faced when training with multiple diverse datasets is the variation in label presence, i.e. the combined data are often partially-labelled. Adaptations of the cross entropy loss function have been proposed to deal with partially labelled data. In this paper we show that training naively with such a loss function and multiple diverse datasets can lead to a form of shortcut learning, where the model associates label presence with domain characteristics, leading to a drop in performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel label dropout scheme to break the link between domain characteristics and the presence or absence of labels. We demonstrate that label dropout improves echo segmentation Dice score by 62% and 25% on two cardiac structures when training using multiple diverse partially labelled datasets.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 16:57:56 UTC (1,419 KB)"

In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them.

Adapting to the speech peculiarities of target users requires many in-domain samples, often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, current on-device learning techniques rely on computationally intensive and memory-hungry backbone update schemes, unfit for always-on, battery-powered devices. In this work, we propose a novel on-device learning architecture, composed of a pretrained backbone and a user-aware embedding learning the user's speech characteristics. The so-generated features are fused and used to classify the input utterance. For domain shifts generated by unseen speakers, we measure error rate reductions of up to 19% from 30.1% to 24.3% based on the 35-class problem of the Google Speech Commands dataset, through the inexpensive update of the user projections. We moreover demonstrate the few-shot learning capabilities of our proposed architecture in sample- and class-scarce learning conditions.

In contrast to the standard approach of training a separate NNQS from scratch at every point of the phase diagram, we demonstrate that the optimization at a highly expressive point of the phase diagram (i.e., close to a phase transition) yields interpretable features that can be reused to accurately describe a wide region across the transition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on different systems in one and two dimensions by initially pretraining a NNQS at a given point of the phase diagram, followed by fine-tuning only the output layer for all other points. Notably, the computational cost of the fine-tuning step is very low compared to the pretraining stage. We argue that the reduced cost of this paradigm has significant potential to advance the exploration of condensed matter systems using NNQS, mirroring the success of fine-tuning in machine learning and natural language processing.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 16:33:32 UTC (4,078 KB)"

By examining the lexical overlap in these datasets and testing the performance of machine learning models, we expose significant text-dependency in trait-labeling. Our results suggest that some machine learning models, especially large pre-trained models like HuBERT, might inadvertently focus on lexical characteristics rather than the intended paralinguistic features.

Indeed, we focus on a function, called Probabilistic Easy Variational Causal Effect (PEACE), which can measure the direct causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ with respect to continuously and interventionally changing the values of $X$ while keeping the value of $Z$ constant. PEACE is a function of $d\ge 0$, which is a degree managing the strengths of probability density values $f(x|z)$. On the other hand, we generalize the above idea for the discrete case and show its compatibility with the continuous case. Further, we investigate some properties of PEACE using measure theoretical concepts. Furthermore, we provide some identifiability criteria and several examples showing the generic capability of PEACE. We note that PEACE can deal with the causal problems for which micro-level or just macro-level changes in the value of the input variables are important. Finally, PEACE is stable under small changes in $\partial g_{in}/\partial x$ and the joint distribution of $X$ and $Z$, where $g_{in}$ is obtained from $g$ by removing all functional relationships defining $X$ and $Z$.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 15:28:21 UTC (193 KB)"

Janssen, Tahlita C.M. Zuiverloon, Chunmig Rong, Kjersti Engan","Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)","Histopathology is a gold standard for cancer diagnosis under a microscopic examination. However, histological tissue processing procedures result in artifacts, which are ultimately transferred to the digitized version of glass slides, known as whole slide images (WSIs). Artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant areas and may result in wrong deep learning (DL) algorithms predictions. Therefore, detecting and excluding artifacts in the computational pathology (CPATH) system is essential for reliable automated diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE) scheme for detecting five notable artifacts, including damaged tissue, blur, folded tissue, air bubbles, and histologically irrelevant blood from WSIs. First, we train independent binary DL models as experts to capture particular artifact morphology. Then, we ensemble their predictions using a fusion mechanism. We apply probabilistic thresholding over the final probability distribution to improve the sensitivity of the MoE. We developed DL pipelines using two MoEs and two multiclass models of state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). DCNNs-based MoE and ViTs-based MoE schemes outperformed simpler multiclass models and were tested on datasets from different hospitals and cancer types, where MoE using DCNNs yielded the best results. The proposed MoE yields 86.15% F1 and 97.93% sensitivity scores on unseen data, retaining less computational cost for inference than MoE using ViTs. This best performance of MoEs comes with relatively higher computational trade-offs than multiclass models. The proposed artifact detection pipeline will not only ensure reliable CPATH predictions but may also provide quality control.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 15:22:05 UTC (54,386 KB)"

Under mild conditions, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated to a kernel is capable of encoding the independence of $M\ge 2$ random variables. Probably the most widespread independence measure relying on kernels is the so-called Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC; also referred to as distance covariance in the statistics literature). Despite various existing HSIC estimators designed since its introduction close to two decades ago, the fundamental question of the rate at which HSIC can be estimated is still open. In this work, we prove that the minimax optimal rate of HSIC estimation on $\mathbb R^d$ for Borel measures containing the Gaussians with continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels is $\mathcal O\!\left(n^{-1/2}\right)$. Specifically, our result implies the optimality in the minimax sense of many of the most-frequently used estimators (including the U-statistic, the V-statistic, and the Nyström-based one) on $\mathbb R^d$.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 15:13:21 UTC (24 KB)"

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a well-known XAI framework for image analysis. It utilizes image segmentation to create features to identify relevant areas for classification. Consequently, poor segmentation can compromise the consistency of the explanation and undermine the importance of the segments, affecting the overall interpretability. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DSEG-LIME (Data-Driven Segmentation LIME), featuring: i) a data-driven segmentation for human-recognized feature generation, and ii) a hierarchical segmentation procedure through composition. We benchmark DSEG-LIME on pre-trained models with images from the ImageNet dataset - scenarios without domain-specific knowledge. The analysis includes a quantitative evaluation using established XAI metrics, complemented by a qualitative assessment through a user study. Our findings demonstrate that DSEG outperforms in most of the XAI metrics and enhances the alignment of explanations with human-recognized concepts, significantly improving interpretability.

To avoid devoting resources to unimportant units, a preliminary selection of the current individual before reporting its prediction interval is common and meaningful in online predictive tasks. Since the online selection causes a temporal multiplicity in the selected prediction intervals, it is important to control the real-time false coverage-statement rate (FCR) to measure the averaged miscoverage error. We develop a general framework named CAS (Calibration after Adaptive Selection) that can wrap around any prediction model and online selection rule to output post-selection prediction intervals. If the current individual is selected, we first perform an adaptive selection on historical data to construct a calibration set, then output a conformal prediction interval for the unobserved label. We provide tractable constructions for the calibration set for popular online selection rules. We proved that CAS can achieve an exact selection-conditional coverage guarantee in the finite-sample and distribution-free regimes. For the decision-driven selection rule, including most online multiple-testing procedures, CAS can exactly control the real-time FCR below the target level without any distributional assumptions. For the online selection with symmetric thresholds, we establish the error bound for the control gap of FCR under mild distributional assumptions. To account for the distribution shift in online data, we also embed CAS into some recent dynamic conformal prediction methods and examine the long-run FCR control. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data corroborate that CAS can effectively control FCR around the target level and yield more narrowed prediction intervals over existing baselines across various settings.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 15:07:20 UTC (208 KB)"

For example, in some applications, a classifier may not have direct access to sensitive attributes, affecting its ability to produce accurate and fair decisions. This paper proposes a framework that models the trade-off between accuracy and fairness under four practical scenarios that dictate the type of data available for analysis. Prior works examine this trade-off by analyzing the outputs of a scoring function that has been trained to implicitly learn the underlying distribution of the feature vector, class label, and sensitive attribute of a dataset. In contrast, our framework directly analyzes the behavior of the optimal Bayesian classifier on this underlying distribution by constructing a discrete approximation it from the dataset itself. This approach enables us to formulate multiple convex optimization problems, which allow us to answer the question: How is the accuracy of a Bayesian classifier affected in different data restricting scenarios when constrained to be fair? Analysis is performed on a set of fairness definitions that include group and individual fairness. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework as a tool for quantifying the trade-offs among different fairness notions and their distributional dependencies.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 15:01:27 UTC (17,987 KB)"

Compared to the empirical success, the theoretical guarantee of shuffling gradient methods was not well-understanding for a long time. Until recently, the convergence rates had just been established for the average iterate for convex functions and the last iterate for strongly convex problems (using squared distance as the metric). However, when using the function value gap as the convergence criterion, existing theories cannot interpret the good performance of the last iterate in different settings (e.g., constrained optimization). To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we prove last-iterate convergence rates for shuffling gradient methods with respect to the objective value even without strong convexity. Our new results either (nearly) match the existing last-iterate lower bounds or are as fast as the previous best upper bounds for the average iterate.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 15:01:17 UTC (65 KB)"

Modern contrastive learning and generative models improved the performance of fMRI-based visual decoding and reconstruction. However, the high cost and low temporal resolution of fMRI limit their applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), prompting a high need for EEG-based visual reconstruction. In this study, we present an EEG-based visual reconstruction framework. It consists of a plug-and-play EEG encoder called the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM), which is aligned with image embeddings, and a two-stage EEG guidance image generator that first transforms EEG features into image priors and then reconstructs the visual stimuli with a pre-trained image generator. Our approach allows EEG embeddings to achieve superior performance in image classification and retrieval tasks. Our two-stage image generation strategy vividly reconstructs images seen by humans. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of signals from different time windows and brain regions on decoding and reconstruction. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data modality. We report that EEG-based visual decoding achieves SOTA performance, highlighting the portability, low cost, and high temporal resolution of EEG, enabling a wide range of BCI applications.

The value function is often trained using the least squares method, which implicitly assumes a Gaussian error distribution. However, a recent study suggested that the error distribution for training the value function is often skewed because of the properties of the Bellman operator, and violates the implicit assumption of normal error distribution in the least squares method. To address this, we proposed a method called Symmetric Q-learning, in which the synthetic noise generated from a zero-mean distribution is added to the target values to generate a Gaussian error distribution. We evaluated the proposed method on continuous control benchmark tasks in MuJoCo.

Controversial topics, including vaccination, abortion, racism, and sexuality, often elicit opinions and attitudes that are not solely based on evidence but rather reflect moral worldviews. Recent advances in natural language processing have demonstrated that moral values can be gauged in human-generated textual content. Here, we design a range of language representation models fine-tuned to capture exactly the moral nuances in text, called MoralBERT. We leverage annotated moral data from three distinct sources: Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook user-generated content covering various socially relevant topics. This approach broadens linguistic diversity and potentially enhances the models' ability to comprehend morality in various contexts. We also explore a domain adaptation technique and compare it to the standard fine-tuned BERT model, using two different frameworks for moral prediction: single-label and multi-label. We compare in-domain approaches with conventional models relying on lexicon-based techniques, as well as a Machine Learning classifier with Word2Vec representation. Our results showed that in-domain prediction models significantly outperformed traditional models. While the single-label setting reaches a higher accuracy than previously achieved for the task when using BERT pretrained models. Experiments in an out-of-domain setting, instead, suggest that further work is needed for existing domain adaptation techniques to generalise between different social media platforms, especially for the multi-label task. The investigations and outcomes from this study pave the way for further exploration, enabling a more profound comprehension of moral narratives about controversial social issues.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 14:12:59 UTC (983 KB)"

This allows for a more efficient utilization of computational resources, activating more experts for complex tasks requiring advanced reasoning and fewer for simpler tasks. Through extensive evaluations, our dynamic routing method demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional Top-2 routing across various benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of 0.7% with less than 90% activated parameters. Further analysis shows our model dispatches more experts to tasks requiring complex reasoning skills, like BBH, confirming its ability to dynamically allocate computational resources in alignment with the input's complexity.

This capability enables data holders to adhere strictly to data protection regulations. However, existing unlearning techniques face practical constraints, often causing performance degradation, demanding brief fine-tuning post unlearning, and requiring significant storage. In response, this paper introduces a novel class of machine unlearning algorithms. First method is partial amnesiac unlearning, integration of layer-wise pruning with amnesiac unlearning. In this method, updates made to the model during training are pruned and stored, subsequently used to forget specific data from trained model. The second method assimilates layer-wise partial-updates into label-flipping and optimization-based unlearning to mitigate the adverse effects of data deletion on model efficacy. Through a detailed experimental evaluation, we showcase the effectiveness of proposed unlearning methods. Experimental results highlight that the partial amnesiac unlearning not only preserves model efficacy but also eliminates the necessity for brief post fine-tuning, unlike conventional amnesiac unlearning.

"51","Robustifying and Boosting Training-Free Neural Architecture Search","Zhenfeng He, Yao Shu, Zhongxiang Dai, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Neural architecture search (NAS) has become a key component of AutoML and a standard tool to automate the design of deep neural networks. Recently, training-free NAS as an emerging paradigm has successfully reduced the search costs of standard training-based NAS by estimating the true architecture performance with only training-free metrics. Nevertheless, the estimation ability of these metrics typically varies across different tasks, making it challenging to achieve robust and consistently good search performance on diverse tasks with only a single training-free metric. Meanwhile, the estimation gap between training-free metrics and the true architecture performances limits training-free NAS to achieve superior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the robustifying and boosting training-free NAS (RoBoT) algorithm which (a) employs the optimized combination of existing training-free metrics explored from Bayesian optimization to develop a robust and consistently better-performing metric on diverse tasks, and (b) applies greedy search, i.e., the exploitation, on the newly developed metric to bridge the aforementioned gap and consequently to boost the search performance of standard training-free NAS further. Remarkably, the expected performance of our RoBoT can be theoretically guaranteed, which improves over the existing training-free NAS under mild conditions with additional interesting insights. Our extensive experiments on various NAS benchmark tasks yield substantial empirical evidence to support our theoretical results.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 12:24:11 UTC (776 KB)"

Although defending against such attacks using differential privacy (DP) has proven effective, determining appropriate DP parameters remains challenging. Current formal guarantees on data reconstruction success suffer from overly theoretical assumptions regarding adversary knowledge about the target data, particularly in the image domain. In this work, we empirically investigate this discrepancy and find that the practicality of these assumptions strongly depends on the domain shift between the data prior and the reconstruction target. We propose a reconstruction attack based on diffusion models (DMs) that assumes adversary access to real-world image priors and assess its implications on privacy leakage under DP-SGD. We show that (1) real-world data priors significantly influence reconstruction success, (2) current reconstruction bounds do not model the risk posed by data priors well, and (3) DMs can serve as effective auditing tools for visualizing privacy leakage.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 12:18:55 UTC (18,756 KB)"

For their widespread open-world application, it is important to explore Federated Learning (FL) settings where individual robots can learn about their unique environments while also learning from each others' experiences. In this paper, we present a novel FL benchmark that evaluates different strategies, using multi-label regression objectives, where each client individually learns to predict the social appropriateness of different robot actions while also sharing their learning with others. Furthermore, splitting the training data by different contexts such that each client incrementally learns across contexts, we present a novel Federated Continual Learning (FCL) benchmark that adapts FL-based methods to use state-of-the-art Continual Learning (CL) methods to continually learn socially appropriate agent behaviours under different contextual settings. Federated Averaging (FedAvg) of weights emerges as a robust FL strategy while rehearsal-based FCL enables incrementally learning the social appropriateness of robot actions, across contextual splits.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 12:16:40 UTC (1,323 KB)"

Training such large-scale models typically requires massive memory and computing resources that exceed those of a single GPU, necessitating distributed training. As GPU performance has rapidly evolved in recent years, computation time has shrunk, thereby increasing the proportion of communication in the overall training time. Therefore, optimizing communication for distributed training has become an urgent issue. In this article, we briefly introduce the general architecture of distributed deep neural network training and analyze relationships among Parallelization Strategy, Collective Communication Library, and Network from the perspective of communication optimization, which forms a three-layer paradigm. We then review current representative research advances with this three-layer paradigm. We find that layers in the current three-layer paradigm are relatively independent, but there is a rich design space for cross-layer collaborative optimization in distributed training scenarios. Therefore, we further advocate a communication-efficient five-layer paradigm underlining opportunities for collaboration designs and look forward to the perspectives of ""Vertical"", ""Horizontal"", ""Intra-Inter"" and ""Host-Net"" collaboration designs. We hope this article can shed some light on future research on communication optimization for distributed training.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 12:15:57 UTC (654 KB)"

We start by expanding the applicability of 3D descriptors of electron localization to superconducting states within the framework of superconducting DFT. We first apply this descriptor to a model system, the hydrogen chain, which allows to prove two main concepts: i) that the electron localization changes very little when the transition from the normal to the superconducting state takes place, i.e. that it can be described at the DFT level from the normal state; and ii) that the formation of molecules can be characterized within this theoretical framework, enabling to filter out systems with marked molecular character and hence with low potential to be good superconductors. These two ideas, are then exploited in real binary and ternary systems, showing i) that the bonding type can be characterized automatically; and ii) that this provides a new index which enables to feed machine learning algorithms for a better prediction of critical temperatures. Overall, this sets a grounded theoretical scenario for an automatic and efficient high-throughput of potential hydrogen based superconductors.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 12:15:45 UTC (4,612 KB)"

The imminent challenge stems from resource scarcity, prompting a deliberate transition to Computing-Network Convergence (CNC) as an auspicious approach for joint resource orchestration. While CNC-based mechanisms have garnered attention, their effectiveness in realizing future services, particularly in use cases like the Metaverse, may encounter limitations due to the continually changing nature of users, services, and resources. Hence, this paper presents the concept of Adaptable CNC (ACNC) as an autonomous Machine Learning (ML)-aided mechanism crafted for the joint orchestration of computing and network resources, catering to dynamic and voluminous user requests with stringent requirements. ACNC encompasses two primary functionalities: state recognition and context detection. Given the intricate nature of the user-service-computing-network space, the paper employs dimension reduction to generate live, holistic, abstract system states in a hierarchical structure. To address the challenges posed by dynamic changes, Continual Learning (CL) is employed, classifying the system state into contexts controlled by dedicated ML agents, enabling them to operate efficiently. These two functionalities are intricately linked within a closed loop overseen by the End-to-End (E2E) orchestrator to allocate resources. The paper introduces the components of ACNC, proposes a Metaverse scenario to exemplify ACNC's role in resource provisioning with Segment Routing v6 (SRv6), outlines ACNC's workflow, details a numerical analysis for efficiency assessment, and concludes with discussions on relevant challenges and potential avenues for future research.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 12:03:16 UTC (6,941 KB)"

In this study, our objective is to evaluate the degree to which auxiliary information, such as seismic phase arrival times or seismic station distribution within a network, dominates the process of deep learning from ground motion records, potentially hindering its effectiveness. We perform a hyperparameter search on two deep learning models to assess their effectiveness in deep learning from ground motion records while also examining the impact of auxiliary information on model performance. Experimental results reveal a strong reliance on the highly correlated P and S phase arrival information.

In this paper we tackle data-to-text for isiXhosa, which is low-resource and agglutinative. We introduce Triples-to-isiXhosa (T2X), a new dataset based on a subset of WebNLG, which presents a new linguistic context that shifts modelling demands to subword-driven techniques. We also develop an evaluation framework for T2X that measures how accurately generated text describes the data. This enables future users of T2X to go beyond surface-level metrics in evaluation. On the modelling side we explore two classes of methods - dedicated data-to-text models trained from scratch and pretrained language models (PLMs). We propose a new dedicated architecture aimed at agglutinative data-to-text, the Subword Segmental Pointer Generator (SSPG). It jointly learns to segment words and copy entities, and outperforms existing dedicated models for 2 agglutinative languages (isiXhosa and Finnish). We investigate pretrained solutions for T2X, which reveals that standard PLMs come up short. Fine-tuning machine translation models emerges as the best method overall. These findings underscore the distinct challenge presented by T2X: neither well-established data-to-text architectures nor customary pretrained methodologies prove optimal.

However, the current tools are not flexible, as they work based on look-up tables that have been created, which map function calls of commonly used ML libraries to ML activities. These tables must be manually adjusted to account for new or changed libraries. This paper presents a more flexible approach to cell classification based on a hybrid classification approach that combines a rule-based and a decision tree classifier. We discuss the design rationales and describe the developed classifiers in detail. We implemented the new flexible cell classification approach in a tool called JupyLabel.

We argue that such a learning scenario is less realistic since a robotic agent is supposed to learn the world continuously as it explores and perceives it. To take a step towards a more realistic embodied agent learning scenario, we propose two continual learning setups for embodied agents; learning new behaviors (Behavior Incremental Learning, Behavior-IL) and new environments (Environment Incremental Learning, Environment-IL) For the tasks, previous 'data prior' based continual learning methods maintain logits for the past tasks. However, the stored information is often insufficiently learned information and requires task boundary information, which might not always be available.

Peierls stress is one of the central concepts in crystal plasticity that measures the strength through the resistance of a dislocation to plastic flow. The determination of Peierls stress involves a multiscale nature depending on both elastic lattice responses and the energy landscape of crystal slips. Material screening by strength via the Peierls stress from first-principles calculations is computationally intractable for the nonlocal characteristics of dislocations, and not included in the state-of-the-art computational material databases. In this work, we propose a physics-transfer framework to learn the physics of crystal plasticity from empirical atomistic simulations and then predict the Peierls stress from chemically accurate density functional theory-based calculations of material parameters. Notably, the strengths of single-crystalline metals can be predicted from a few single-point calculations for the deformed lattice and on the {\gamma} surface, allowing efficient, high-throughput screening for material discovery. Uncertainty quantification is carried out to assess the accuracy of models and sources of errors, showing reduced physical and system uncertainties in the predictions by elevating the fidelity of training models. This physics-transfer framework can be generalized to other problems facing the accuracy-performance dilemma, by harnessing the hierarchy of physics in the multiscale models of materials science.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 11:05:05 UTC (20,171 KB)"

In this paper, we propose the universal dependence of $|t_1|$ and $u$ on the CF and structural features in hole doped cuprates with a single CuO$_2$ layer sandwiched between block layers. To do so, we perform extensive \textit{ab initio} calculations of $|t_1|$ and $u$ and analyze the results by employing a machine learning method called Hierarchical Dependence Extraction (HDE). The main results are the following: (a) $|t_1|$ has a main-order dependence on the radii $R_{\rm X}$ and $R_{\rm A}$ of the apical anion X and cation A in the block layer. ($|t_1|$ increases when $R_{\rm X}$ or $R_{\rm A}$ decreases.) (b) $u$ has a main-order dependence on the negative ionic charge $Z_{\rm X}$ of X and the hole doping $\delta$ of the AB orbital. ($u$ decreases when $|Z_{\rm X}|$ increases or $\delta$ increases.) We elucidate and discuss the microscopic mechanism of (a,b). We demonstrate the predictive power of the HDE by showing the consistency between (a,b) and results from previous works. The present results provide a basis for optimizing SC properties in cuprates and possibly akin materials.

However, the minimum fuel consumption of an HEV for a battery electrical balance case under a specific assembly condition and a specific speed curve still needs to be clarified in academia and industry. Regarding this problem, this work provides the mathematical expression of constrained optimal fuel consumption (COFC) from the perspective of constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) for the first time globally. Also, two mainstream approaches of CRL, constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) and Lagrangian-based approaches, are utilized for the first time to obtain the vehicle's minimum fuel consumption under the battery electrical balance condition. We conduct case studies on the well-known Prius TOYOTA hybrid system (THS) under the NEDC condition; we give vital steps to implement CRL approaches and compare the performance between the CVPO and Lagrangian-based approaches. Our case study found that CVPO and Lagrangian-based approaches can obtain the lowest fuel consumption while maintaining the SOC balance constraint. The CVPO approach converges stable, but the Lagrangian-based approach can obtain the lowest fuel consumption at 3.95 L/100km, though with more significant oscillations. This result verifies the effectiveness of our proposed CRL approaches to the COFC problem.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:42:32 UTC (2,433 KB)"

Vivek, Prakash Gaikwad","Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)","We introduce FLAME, a machine learning algorithm designed to fit Voigt profiles to HI Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) absorption lines using deep convolutional neural networks. FLAME integrates two algorithms: the first determines the number of components required to fit Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines, and the second calculates the Doppler parameter $b$, the HI column density N$_{\rm HI}$, and the velocity separation of individual components. For the current version of FLAME, we trained it on low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forests observed with the Far Ultraviolet gratings of the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Drawing on this data, we trained FLAME on $\sim$ $10^6$ simulated Voigt profiles, forward-modeled to Ly$\alpha$ absorption lines observed with HST-COS, to classify lines as either single or double components and then determine Voigt profile fitting parameters. FLAME shows impressive accuracy on the simulated data by identifying more than 98% (90%) of single (double) component lines. It determines $b$ values within $\approx \pm{8}~(15)$ km s$^{-1}$ and log $N_{\rm HI}/ {\rm cm}^2$ values within $\approx \pm 0.3~(0.8)$ for 90% of the single (double) component lines. However, when applied to real data, FLAME's component classification accuracy drops by $\sim$ 10%. Despite this, there is a reasonable agreement between the $b$ and N$_{\rm HI}$ distributions obtained from traditional Voigt profile fitting methods and FLAME's predictions. Our mock HST-COS data analysis, designed to emulate real data parameters, demonstrated that FLAME could achieve consistent accuracy comparable to its performance with simulated data. This finding suggests that the drop in FLAME's accuracy when used on real data primarily arises from the difficulty of replicating the full complexity of real data in the training sample.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:37:22 UTC (2,728 KB)"

We then apply these metrics to solve several problems in data analysis of signed graphs in a unified way. They include the partitioning of signed graphs, dimensionality reduction, finding hierarchies of alliances in signed networks as well as the quantification of the degree of polarization between the existing factions in systems represented by this type of graphs.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:32:35 UTC (4,581 KB)"
"76","XpertAI: uncovering model strategies for sub-manifolds","Simon Letzgus, Klaus-Robert Müller, Grégoire Montavon","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","In recent years, Explainable AI (XAI) methods have facilitated profound validation and knowledge extraction from ML models. While extensively studied for classification, few XAI solutions have addressed the challenges specific to regression models. In regression, explanations need to be precisely formulated to address specific user queries (e.g.\ distinguishing between `Why is the output above 0?' and `Why is the output above 50?'). They should furthermore reflect the model's behavior on the relevant data sub-manifold. In this paper, we introduce XpertAI, a framework that disentangles the prediction strategy into multiple range-specific sub-strategies and allows the formulation of precise queries about the model (the `explanandum') as a linear combination of those sub-strategies. XpertAI is formulated generally to work alongside popular XAI attribution techniques, based on occlusion, gradient integration, or reverse propagation. Qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrate the benefits of our approach.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:21:31 UTC (1,609 KB)"

The algorithm alternates polynomial approximation with Bayesian optimization steps, using Gaussian processes to model the error between the objective and its polynomial fit. We describe the algorithmic design of PMBO and compare the results of the performance of PMBO with several optimization methods for a set of analytic test functions. The results show that PMBO outperforms the classic Bayesian optimization and is robust with respect to the choice of its correlation function family and its hyper-parameter setting, which, on the contrary, need to be carefully tuned in classic Bayesian optimization. Remarkably, PMBO performs comparably with state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms such as the Covariance Matrix Adaptation -- Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). This finding suggests that PMBO emerges as the pivotal choice among surrogate-based optimization methods when addressing low-dimensional optimization problems. Hereby, the simple nature of polynomials opens the opportunity for interpretation and analysis of the inferred surrogate model, providing a macroscopic perspective on the landscape of the objective function.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:21:21 UTC (1,861 KB)"

Leveraging advancements in sensor technology and machine learning, we propose a non-invasive diabetes diagnosis using a Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) with batch normalization, incorporating data re-sampling and normalization for class balancing. Our method addresses existing challenges such as limited performance associated with traditional machine learning. Experimental results on three datasets show significant improvements in overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to traditional methods. Notably, we achieve accuracies of 89.81% in Pima diabetes dataset, 75.49% in CDC BRFSS2015 dataset, and 95.28% in Mesra Diabetes dataset.

In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FMs). While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval. In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization. Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types. To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity. To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type. This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data. Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:12:59 UTC (940 KB)"

Traditionally limited by a scarcity of species observations, these models have significantly improved in performance through the integration of larger datasets provided by citizen science initiatives. However, they still suffer from the strong class imbalance between species within these datasets, often resulting in the penalization of rare species--those most critical for conservation efforts. To tackle this issue, this study assesses the effectiveness of training deep learning models using a balanced presence-only loss function on large citizen science-based datasets. We demonstrate that this imbalance-aware loss function outperforms traditional loss functions across various datasets and tasks, particularly in accurately modeling rare species with limited observations.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:08:36 UTC (70 KB)"

It plays a key role in statistics and optimization: many learning problems (notably from optimal transport, generative modeling, and algorithmic fairness) include constraints or penalties framed as push-forward conditions on the model. However, the literature lacks general theoretical insights on the (non)convexity of such constraints and its consequences on the associated learning problems. This paper aims at filling this gap. In a first part, we provide a range of sufficient and necessary conditions for the (non)convexity of two sets of functions: the maps transporting one probability measure to another; the maps inducing equal output distributions across distinct probability measures. This highlights that for most probability measures, these push-forward constraints are not convex. In a second time, we show how this result implies critical limitations on the design of convex optimization problems for learning generative models or group-fair predictors. This work will hopefully help researchers and practitioners have a better understanding of the critical impact of push-forward conditions onto convexity.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:06:48 UTC (27 KB)"

Existing CFA schemes suffer from impractical assumptions, such as requiring access to the prover's internal state (e.g., memory or code), the complete Control-Flow Graph (CFG) of the prover's software, large sets of measurements, or tailor-made hardware. Moreover, current CFA schemes are inadequate for attesting embedded systems due to their high computational overhead and resource usage. In this paper, we overcome the limitations of existing CFA schemes for embedded devices by introducing RAGE, a novel, lightweight CFA approach with minimal requirements. RAGE can detect Code Reuse Attacks (CRA), including control- and non-control-data attacks. It efficiently extracts features from one execution trace and leverages Unsupervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deviations from benign executions. The core intuition behind RAGE is to exploit the correspondence between execution trace, execution graph, and execution embeddings to eliminate the unrealistic requirement of having access to a complete CFG. We evaluate RAGE on embedded benchmarks and demonstrate that (i) it detects 40 real-world attacks on embedded software; (ii) Further, we stress our scheme with synthetic return-oriented programming (ROP) and data-oriented programming (DOP) attacks on the real-world embedded software benchmark Embench, achieving 98.03% (ROP) and 91.01% (DOP) F1-Score while maintaining a low False Positive Rate of 3.19%; (iii) Additionally, we evaluate RAGE on OpenSSL, used by millions of devices and achieve 97.49% and 84.42% F1-Score for ROP and DOP attack detection, with an FPR of 5.47%.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:00:06 UTC (1,447 KB)"

The rationale behind our approach relies on the fact that, the independence hypothesis $\mathcal{H}\_0$ is necessarily false as soon as the optimal scoring function related to the pair of distributions $(H\otimes G,\; F)$, obtained from a bipartite ranking algorithm, has a ROC curve that deviates from the main diagonal of the unit square.We consider a wide class of rank statistics encompassing many ways of deviating from the diagonal in the ROC space to build tests of independence. Beyond its great flexibility, this new method has theoretical properties that far surpass those of its competitors. Nonasymptotic bounds for the two types of testing errors are established. From an empirical perspective, the novel procedure we promote in this paper exhibits a remarkable ability to detect small departures, of various types, from the null assumption $\mathcal{H}_0$, even in high dimension, as supported by the numerical experiments presented here.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:00:00 UTC (579 KB)"

However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches, due to the system's exploration of a vast configuration space. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. The proposed methodology involves parameterizing the time-evolving quantum state, enabling the approximation of the state's evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations. We also show that we can incorporate neural networks to parameterize these functions. The time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique is employed to efficiently compute the optimal time-dependent parameters. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 09:37:22 UTC (3,622 KB)"

Our approach to adaptation employs proximal causal learning, a technique for estimating causal effects in settings where proxies of unobserved confounders are available. We demonstrate that proxy variables allow for adaptation to distribution shift without explicitly recovering or modeling latent variables. We consider two settings, (i) Concept Bottleneck: an additional ''concept'' variable is observed that mediates the relationship between the covariates and labels; (ii) Multi-domain: training data from multiple source domains is available, where each source domain exhibits a different distribution over the latent confounder. We develop a two-stage kernel estimation approach to adapt to complex distribution shifts in both settings.

In this article, we focus on knowledge transfer for unsupervised learning tasks in contrast to the supervised learning tasks in the literature. Given the transferable source populations, we propose a two-step transfer learning algorithm to extract useful information from multiple source principal component analysis (PCA) studies, thereby enhancing estimation accuracy for the target PCA task. In the first step, we integrate the shared subspace information across multiple studies by a proposed method named as Grassmannian barycenter, instead of directly performing PCA on the pooled dataset. The proposed Grassmannian barycenter method enjoys robustness and computational advantages in more general cases. Then the resulting estimator for the shared subspace from the first step is further utilized to estimate the target private subspace in the second step. Our theoretical analysis credits the gain of knowledge transfer between PCA studies to the enlarged eigenvalue gap, which is different from the existing supervised transfer learning tasks where sparsity plays the central role. In addition, we prove that the bilinear forms of the empirical spectral projectors have asymptotic normality under weaker eigenvalue gap conditions after knowledge transfer. When the set of informativesources is unknown, we endow our algorithm with the capability of useful dataset selection by solving a rectified optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold, which in turn leads to a computationally friendly rectified Grassmannian K-means procedure. In the end, extensive numerical simulation results and a real data case concerning activity recognition are reported to support our theoretical claims and to illustrate the empirical usefulness of the proposed transfer learning methods.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 09:15:12 UTC (2,236 KB)"

In particular we allow the predictor to learn as it receives larger parts of the input, with the ultimate goal of designing online learning algorithms specifically tailored for the algorithmic task at hand. Adopting this perspective, we focus on a number of fundamental problems, including caching and scheduling, which have been well-studied in the black-box setting.

These strategies allow for swift predictions by making decisions early in the network, thereby conserving computation time and resources. However, so far the early-exit networks have only been developed for stationary data distributions, which restricts their application in real-world scenarios with continuous non-stationary data. This study aims to explore the continual learning of the early-exit networks. We adapt existing continual learning methods to fit with early-exit architectures and investigate their behavior in the continual setting. We notice that early network layers exhibit reduced forgetting and can outperform standard networks even when using significantly fewer resources. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of task-recency bias on early-exit inference and propose Task-wise Logits Correction (TLC), a simple method that equalizes this bias and improves the network performance for every given compute budget in the class-incremental setting. We assess the accuracy and computational cost of various continual learning techniques enhanced with early-exits and TLC across standard class-incremental learning benchmarks such as 10 split CIFAR100 and ImageNetSubset and show that TLC can achieve the accuracy of the standard methods using less than 70\% of their computations. Moreover, at full computational budget, our method outperforms the accuracy of the standard counterparts by up to 15 percentage points.

The primary challenge of TTA is limited access to the entire test dataset during online updates, causing error accumulation. To mitigate it, TTA methods have utilized the model output's entropy as a confidence metric that aims to determine which samples have a lower likelihood of causing error. Through experimental studies, however, we observed the unreliability of entropy as a confidence metric for TTA under biased scenarios and theoretically revealed that it stems from the neglect of the influence of latent disentangled factors of data on predictions. Building upon these findings, we introduce a novel TTA method named Destroy Your Object (DeYO), which leverages a newly proposed confidence metric named Pseudo-Label Probability Difference (PLPD). PLPD quantifies the influence of the shape of an object on prediction by measuring the difference between predictions before and after applying an object-destructive transformation.

This leads to the problem of machine unlearning (MU), aiming to eliminate the influence of chosen data points on model performance, while still maintaining the model's utility post-unlearning. Despite various MU methods for data influence erasure, evaluations have largely focused on random data forgetting, ignoring the vital inquiry into which subset should be chosen to truly gauge the authenticity of unlearning performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new evaluative angle for MU from an adversarial viewpoint. We propose identifying the data subset that presents the most significant challenge for influence erasure, i.e., pinpointing the worst-case forget set. Utilizing a bi-level optimization principle, we amplify unlearning challenges at the upper optimization level to emulate worst-case scenarios, while simultaneously engaging in standard training and unlearning at the lower level, achieving a balance between data influence erasure and model utility. Our proposal offers a worst-case evaluation of MU's resilience and effectiveness. Through extensive experiments across different datasets (including CIFAR-10, 100, CelebA, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet) and models (including both image classifiers and generative models), we expose critical pros and cons in existing (approximate) unlearning strategies.

It is rare, however, that the data and task changes are completely unpredictable. Given a description of an overarching goal or data theme, which we call a realm, humans can often guess what concepts are associated with it. We show here that the combination of a large language model and an image generation model can similarly provide useful premonitions as to how a continual learning challenge might develop over time. We use the large language model to generate text descriptions of semantically related classes that might potentially appear in the data stream in future. These descriptions are then rendered using Stable Diffusion to generate new labelled image samples. The resulting synthetic dataset is employed for supervised pre-training, but is discarded prior to commencing continual learning, along with the pre-training classification head. We find that the backbone of our pre-trained networks can learn representations useful for the downstream continual learning problem, thus becoming a valuable input to any existing continual learning method.

"100","IM-Unpack: Training and Inference with Arbitrarily Low Precision Integers","Zhanpeng Zeng, Karthikeyan Sankaralingam, Vikas Singh","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","GEneral Matrix Multiply (GEMM) is a central operation in deep learning and corresponds to the largest chunk of the compute footprint. Therefore, improving its efficiency is an active topic of ongoing research. A popular strategy is the use of low bit-width integers to approximate the original entries in a matrix. This allows efficiency gains, but often requires sophisticated techniques to control the rounding error incurred. In this work, we first verify/check that when the low bit-width restriction is removed, for a variety of Transformer-based models, whether integers are sufficient for all GEMMs need -- for {\em both} training and inference stages, and can achieve parity with floating point counterparts. No sophisticated techniques are needed. We find that while a large majority of entries in matrices (encountered in such models) can be easily represented by {\em low} bit-width integers, the existence of a few heavy hitter entries make it difficult to achieve efficiency gains via the exclusive use of low bit-width GEMMs alone. To address this issue, we develop a simple algorithm, Integer Matrix Unpacking (IM-Unpack), to {\em unpack} a matrix with large integer entries into a larger matrix whose entries all lie within the representable range of arbitrarily low bit-width integers. This allows {\em equivalence} with the original GEMM, i.e., the exact result can be obtained using purely low bit-width integer GEMMs. This comes at the cost of additional operations -- we show that for many popular models, this overhead is quite small.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 05:44:27 UTC (863 KB)"

Existing geo-textual indexes for TkQs use traditional retrieval models like BM25 to compute text relevance and usually exploit a simple linear function to compute spatial relevance, but its effectiveness is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues. To the best of our knowledge, there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST). LIST is featured with two novel components. Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance. Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 19.21% and 12.79% in terms of NDCG@1 and Recall@10, and is three orders of magnitude faster than the most effective baseline.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 05:32:33 UTC (4,123 KB)"

To prevent overfitting to a specific domain, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) reduces source domain's loss sharpness. Although SAM variants have delivered significant improvements in DG, we highlight that there's still potential for improvement in generalizing to unknown domains through the exploration on data space. This paper introduces an objective rooted in both parameter and data perturbed regions for domain generalization, coined Unknown Domain Inconsistency Minimization (UDIM). UDIM reduces the loss landscape inconsistency between source domain and unknown domains. As unknown domains are inaccessible, these domains are empirically crafted by perturbing instances from the source domain dataset. In particular, by aligning the loss landscape acquired in the source domain to the loss landscape of perturbed domains, we expect to achieve generalization grounded on these flat minima for the unknown domains. Theoretically, we validate that merging SAM optimization with the UDIM objective establishes an upper bound for the true objective of the DG task. In an empirical aspect, UDIM consistently outperforms SAM variants across multiple DG benchmark datasets. Notably, UDIM shows statistically significant improvements in scenarios with more restrictive domain information, underscoring UDIM's generalization capability in unseen domains.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown great potential in solving the KT problem. However, there still exist some important challenges when applying deep learning techniques to model the KT process. The first challenge lies in taking the individual information of the question into modeling. This is crucial because, despite questions sharing the same knowledge component (KC), students' knowledge acquisition on homogeneous questions can vary significantly. The second challenge lies in interpreting the prediction results from existing deep learning-based KT models. In real-world applications, while it may not be necessary to have complete transparency and interpretability of the model parameters, it is crucial to present the model's prediction results in a manner that teachers find interpretable. This makes teachers accept the rationale behind the prediction results and utilize them to design teaching activities and tailored learning strategies for students. However, the inherent black-box nature of deep learning techniques often poses a hurdle for teachers to fully embrace the model's prediction results.

Thus far, neural compression design involves transforming the source to a latent vector, which is then rounded to integers and entropy coded. While this approach has been shown to be optimal in a one-shot sense on certain sources, we show that it is highly sub-optimal on i.i.d. sequences, and in fact always recovers scalar quantization of the original source sequence. We demonstrate that the sub-optimality is due to the choice of quantization scheme in the latent space, and not the transform design. By employing lattice quantization instead of scalar quantization in the latent space, we demonstrate that Lattice Transform Coding (LTC) is able to recover optimal vector quantization at various dimensions and approach the asymptotically-achievable rate-distortion function at reasonable complexity. On general vector sources, LTC improves upon standard neural compressors in one-shot coding performance. LTC also enables neural compressors that perform block coding on i.i.d. vector sources, which yields coding gain over optimal one-shot coding.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 05:09:25 UTC (45,315 KB)"

Therefore, this study focuses on (1) FACS-labeled, customizable avatar-based expression stimuli for maintaining subjects' engagement, (2) learning-based measurements that quantify subjects' facial responses to such stimuli, and (3) validation of constructs represented by stimulus-measurement pairs.

Despite algorithmic efforts to improve the minority group accuracy, a theoretical generalization analysis of ERM on individual groups remains elusive. By formulating the group imbalance problem with the Gaussian Mixture Model, this paper quantifies the impact of individual groups on the sample complexity, the convergence rate, and the average and group-level testing performance. Although our theoretical framework is centered on binary classification using a one-hidden-layer neural network, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the group-level generalization of ERM in addition to the commonly studied average generalization performance. Sample insights of our theoretical results include that when all group-level co-variance is in the medium regime and all mean are close to zero, the learning performance is most desirable in the sense of a small sample complexity, a fast training rate, and a high average and group-level testing accuracy. Moreover, we show that increasing the fraction of the minority group in the training data does not necessarily improve the generalization performance of the minority group. Our theoretical results are validated on both synthetic and empirical datasets, such as CelebA and CIFAR-10 in image classification.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 04:38:05 UTC (4,426 KB)"

To address this shortcoming, recent approaches use self-supervised learning techniques to learn these functions using training data that are periodically generated by a verification procedure, leading to a verification-aided learning framework. Despite its immense potential in automating barrier function synthesis, the verification-aided learning framework does not have termination guarantees and may suffer from a low success rate of finding a valid barrier function in practice. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach to address these drawbacks. With a convex formulation of the barrier function synthesis, we propose to first learn an empirically well-behaved NN basis function and then apply a fine-tuning algorithm that exploits the convexity and counterexamples from the verification failure to find a valid barrier function with finite-step termination guarantees: if there exist valid barrier functions, the fine-tuning algorithm is guaranteed to find one in a finite number of iterations.

Recently, Anderson acceleration has gained prominence owing to its exceptional performance for speeding up fixed-point iteration, with numerous recent studies applying it to gradient-based algorithms. Motivated by the powerful impact of Anderson acceleration, we propose an Anderson-accelerated IRL1 algorithm and establish its local linear convergence rate. We extend this convergence result, typically observed in smooth settings, to a nonsmooth scenario. Importantly, our theoretical results do not depend on the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz condition, a necessary condition in existing Nesterov acceleration-based algorithms.

Under a random matrix theoretic assumption on the data distribution and an eigendecay assumption on the data covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$, we demonstrate that any near-interpolator exhibits rapid norm growth: for $\tau$ fixed, $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ has squared $\ell_2$-norm $\mathbb{E}[\|{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\|_{2}^{2}] = \Omega(n^{\alpha})$ where $n$ is the number of samples and $\alpha >1$ is the exponent of the eigendecay, i.e., $\lambda_i(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}) \sim i^{-\alpha}$. This implies that existing data-independent norm-based bounds are necessarily loose. On the other hand, in the same regime we precisely characterize the asymptotic trade-off between interpolation and generalization. Our characterization reveals that larger norm scaling exponents $\alpha$ correspond to worse trade-offs between interpolation and generalization.

This broadens the validity of our conformal coverage guarantees to include incorrectly classified objects, ensuring their usefulness when maximal safety assurances are required. Moreover, we investigate novel ensemble and quantile regression formulations to ensure the bounding box intervals are adaptive to object size, leading to a more balanced coverage across sizes.

To remedy this issue, recent Advantage-Weighted (AW) methods prioritize samples with high advantage values for agent training while inevitably leading to overfitting on these samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel Advantage-Aware Policy Optimization (A2PO) method to explicitly construct advantage-aware policy constraints for offline learning under mixed-quality datasets. Specifically, A2PO employs a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) to disentangle the action distributions of intertwined behavior policies by modeling the advantage values of all training data as conditional variables. Then the agent can follow such disentangled action distribution constraints to optimize the advantage-aware policy towards high advantage values. Extensive experiments conducted on both the single-quality and mixed-quality datasets of the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that A2PO yields results superior to state-of-the-art counterparts.

For precise and efficient task identification, existing OMRL research suggests learning separate task representations that be incorporated with policy input, thus forming a context-based meta-policy. A major approach to train task representations is to adopt contrastive learning using multi-task offline data. The dataset typically encompasses interactions from various policies (i.e., the behavior policies), thus providing a plethora of contextual information regarding different tasks. Nonetheless, amassing data from a substantial number of policies is not only impractical but also often unattainable in realistic settings. Instead, we resort to a more constrained yet practical scenario, where multi-task data collection occurs with a limited number of policies. We observed that learned task representations from previous OMRL methods tend to correlate spuriously with the behavior policy instead of reflecting the essential characteristics of the task, resulting in unfavorable out-of-distribution generalization. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm to disentangle the impact of behavior policy from task representation learning through a process called adversarial data augmentation. Specifically, the objective of adversarial data augmentation is not merely to generate data analogous to offline data distribution; instead, it aims to create adversarial examples designed to confound learned task representations and lead to incorrect task identification. Our experiments show that learning from such adversarial samples significantly enhances the robustness and effectiveness of the task identification process and realizes satisfactory out-of-distribution generalization.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 02:38:36 UTC (3,468 KB)"

However, effectively integrating these models with downstream planners and model-based control approaches is still an open problem. Although these models have conventionally been evaluated for open-loop prediction, we show that they can be used to parameterize autoregressive closed-loop models without retraining. We consider recent trajectory prediction approaches which leverage learned anchor embeddings to predict multiple trajectories, finding that these anchor embeddings can parameterize discrete and distinct modes representing high-level driving behaviors. We propose to perform fully reactive closed-loop planning over these discrete latent modes, allowing us to tractably model the causal interactions between agents at each step. We validate our approach on a suite of more dynamic merging scenarios, finding that our approach avoids the $\textit{frozen robot problem}$ which is pervasive in conventional planners. Our approach also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in CARLA on challenging dense traffic scenarios when evaluated at realistic speeds.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 01:00:52 UTC (3,615 KB)"

But the imbalance between the compute capabilities of GPUs and CPUs is huge. Motivated by these considerations, we study a module which is a workhorse within modern DNN architectures, GEMM based Feed Forward Networks (FFNs), and assess the extent to which it can be made compute- (or FLOP-) lite. Specifically, we propose an alternative formulation (we call it LookupFFN) to GEMM based FFNs inspired by the recent studies of using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to approximate FFNs. Our formulation recasts most essential operations as a memory look-up, leveraging the trade-off between the two resources on any platform: compute and memory (since CPUs offer it in abundance). For RoBERTa language model pretraining, our formulation achieves similar performance compared to GEMM based FFNs, while dramatically reducing the required FLOP. Our development is complemented with a detailed hardware profiling of strategies that will maximize efficiency -- not just on contemporary hardware but on products that will be offered in the near/medium term future.

Kanhere","Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)","While location trajectories represent a valuable data source for analyses and location-based services, they can reveal sensitive information, such as political and religious preferences. Differentially private publication mechanisms have been proposed to allow for analyses under rigorous privacy guarantees. However, the traditional protection schemes suffer from a limiting privacy-utility trade-off and are vulnerable to correlation and reconstruction attacks. Synthetic trajectory data generation and release represent a promising alternative to protection algorithms. While initial proposals achieve remarkable utility, they fail to provide rigorous privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a framework for designing a privacy-preserving trajectory publication approach by defining five design goals, particularly stressing the importance of choosing an appropriate Unit of Privacy. Based on this framework, we briefly discuss the existing trajectory protection approaches, emphasising their shortcomings. This work focuses on the systematisation of the state-of-the-art generative models for trajectories in the context of the proposed framework. We find that no existing solution satisfies all requirements. Thus, we perform an experimental study evaluating the applicability of six sequential generative models to the trajectory domain. Finally, we conclude that a generative trajectory model providing semantic guarantees remains an open research question and propose concrete next steps for future research.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:25:14 UTC (4,163 KB)"

Rossi, Sungchul Kim, Shuai Li","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Web-based applications such as chatbots, search engines and news recommendations continue to grow in scale and complexity with the recent surge in the adoption of LLMs. Online model selection has thus garnered increasing attention due to the need to choose the best model among a diverse set while balancing task reward and exploration cost. Organizations faces decisions like whether to employ a costly API-based LLM or a locally finetuned small LLM, weighing cost against performance. Traditional selection methods often evaluate every candidate model before choosing one, which are becoming impractical given the rising costs of training and finetuning LLMs. Moreover, it is undesirable to allocate excessive resources towards exploring poor-performing models. While some recent works leverage online bandit algorithm to manage such exploration-exploitation trade-off in model selection, they tend to overlook the increasing-then-converging trend in model performances as the model is iteratively finetuned, leading to less accurate predictions and suboptimal model selections. In this paper, we propose a time-increasing bandit algorithm TI-UCB, which effectively predicts the increase of model performances due to finetuning and efficiently balances exploration and exploitation in model selection. To further capture the converging points of models, we develop a change detection mechanism by comparing consecutive increase predictions. We theoretically prove that our algorithm achieves a logarithmic regret upper bound in a typical increasing bandit setting, which implies a fast convergence rate. The advantage of our method is also empirically validated through extensive experiments on classification model selection and online selection of LLMs. Our results highlight the importance of utilizing increasing-then-converging pattern for more efficient and economic model selection in the deployment of LLMs.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 23:52:46 UTC (6,322 KB)"

In this work, we study the exact mean integrated squared error (MISE) of ""sliding window"" Gaussian Kernel Density Estimators for evolving Gaussian densities.

Current diagnostic methods rely on infrequent clinical observations, which can only determine a patient's ABD status after onset. Our research attempts to solve these problems by harnessing Electronic Health Records (EHR) data to develop automated methods for ABD prediction for patients in the ICU. Existing models solely predict a single state (e.g., either delirium or coma), require at least 24 hours of observation data to make predictions, do not dynamically predict fluctuating ABD conditions during ICU stay (typically a one-time prediction), and use small sample size, proprietary single-hospital datasets. Our research fills these gaps in the existing literature by dynamically predicting delirium, coma, and mortality for 12-hour intervals throughout an ICU stay and validating on two public datasets. Our research also introduces the concept of dynamically predicting critical transitions from non-ABD to ABD and between different ABD states in real time, which could be clinically more informative for the hospital staff. We compared the predictive performance of two state-of-the-art neural network models, the MAMBA selective state space model and the Longformer Transformer model. Using the MAMBA model, we achieved a mean area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.95 on outcome prediction of ABD for 12-hour intervals. The model achieves a mean AUROC of 0.79 when predicting transitions between ABD states.

Fair and accurate assessment of client contributions is an important problem in FL to facilitate incentive allocation and encouraging diverse clients to participate in a unified model training. Existing methods for assessing client contribution adopts co-operative game-theoretic concepts, such as Shapley values, but under simplified assumptions. In this paper, we propose a history-aware game-theoretic framework, called FLContrib, to assess client contributions when a subset of (potentially non-i.i.d.) clients participate in each epoch of FL training. By exploiting the FL training process and linearity of Shapley value, we develop FLContrib that yields a historical timeline of client contributions as FL training progresses over epochs. Additionally, to assess client contribution under limited computational budget, we propose a scheduling procedure that considers a two-sided fairness criteria to perform expensive Shapley value computation only in a subset of training epochs. In experiments, we demonstrate a controlled trade-off between the correctness and efficiency of client contributions assessed via FLContrib.

Unlike the well-studied with-replacement variants, SEG with Random Reshuffling (SEG-RR) lacks established theoretical guarantees. In this work, we provide a convergence analysis of SEG-RR for three classes of VIPs: (i) strongly monotone, (ii) affine, and (iii) monotone. We derive conditions under which SEG-RR achieves a faster convergence rate than the uniform with-replacement sampling SEG. In the monotone setting, our analysis of SEG-RR guarantees convergence to an arbitrary accuracy without large batch sizes, a strong requirement needed in the classical with-replacement SEG.

For heterogeneous agent types, I identify a condition that allows the problem to be reduced to Lipschitz bandits directly. For identical agents, I give a polynomial sample complexity scheme to learn the optimal contract based on inverse game theory. For strategic non-myopic agents, I design a low strategic-regret mechanism. Also, I identify a connection between linear contracts and posted-price auctions, showing the two can be reduced to one another, and give a regret lower bound on learning the optimal linear contract based on this observation.

However, effectively reducing these models to their low-bit counterparts without compromising the original accuracy remains a key challenge. In this paper, we propose an innovative PTQ algorithm termed COMQ, which sequentially conducts coordinate-wise minimization of the layer-wise reconstruction errors. We consider the widely used integer quantization, where every quantized weight can be decomposed into a shared floating-point scalar and an integer bit-code. Within a fixed layer, COMQ treats all the scaling factor(s) and bit-codes as the variables of the reconstruction error. Every iteration improves this error along a single coordinate while keeping all other variables constant. COMQ is easy to use and requires no hyper-parameter tuning. It instead involves only dot products and rounding operations. We update these variables in a carefully designed greedy order, significantly enhancing the accuracy. COMQ achieves remarkable results in quantizing 4-bit Vision Transformers, with a negligible loss of less than 1% in Top-1 accuracy. In 4-bit INT quantization of convolutional neural networks, COMQ maintains near-lossless accuracy with a minimal drop of merely 0.3% in Top-1 accuracy.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 20:04:03 UTC (667 KB)"

On the other hand, data augmentation methods, specifically mosaic and mixup, significantly enhance the model's mean Average Precision (mAP), by introducing more variability and complexity into the training data.

Uribe, Rahul Dodhia, Juan L. Ferres, Arman Rahmim","Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)","Automated slice classification is clinically relevant since it can be incorporated into medical image segmentation workflows as a preprocessing step that would flag slices with a higher probability of containing tumors, thereby directing physicians attention to the important slices. In this work, we train a ResNet-18 network to classify axial slices of lymphoma PET/CT images (collected from two institutions) depending on whether the slice intercepted a tumor (positive slice) in the 3D image or if the slice did not (negative slice). Various instances of the network were trained on 2D axial datasets created in different ways: (i) slice-level split and (ii) patient-level split; inputs of different types were used: (i) only PET slices and (ii) concatenated PET and CT slices; and different training strategies were employed: (i) center-aware (CAW) and (ii) center-agnostic (CAG). Model performances were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and various binary classification metrics. We observe and describe a performance overestimation in the case of slice-level split as compared to the patient-level split training. The model trained using patient-level split data with the network input containing only PET slices in the CAG training regime was the best performing/generalizing model on a majority of metrics. Our models were additionally more closely compared using the sensitivity metric on the positive slices from their respective test sets.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 18:57:45 UTC (22,120 KB)"
"150","Overcoming the Paradox of Certified Training with Gaussian Smoothing","Stefan Balauca, Mark Niklas Müller, Yuhao Mao, Maximilian Baader, Marc Fischer, Martin Vechev","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Training neural networks with high certified accuracy against adversarial examples remains an open problem despite significant efforts. While certification methods can effectively leverage tight convex relaxations for bound computation, in training, these methods perform worse than looser relaxations. Prior work hypothesized that this is caused by the discontinuity and perturbation sensitivity of the loss surface induced by these tighter relaxations. In this work, we show theoretically that Gaussian Loss Smoothing can alleviate both of these issues. We confirm this empirically by proposing a certified training method combining PGPE, an algorithm computing gradients of a smoothed loss, with different convex relaxations. When using this training method, we observe that tighter bounds indeed lead to strictly better networks that can outperform state-of-the-art methods on the same network. While scaling PGPE-based training remains challenging due to high computational cost, our results clearly demonstrate the promise of Gaussian Loss Smoothing for training certifiably robust neural networks.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 18:44:36 UTC (1,597 KB)"
