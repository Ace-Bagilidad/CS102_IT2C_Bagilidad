"28",28,"mens jackets","columbia","shinerburke","        first off, i love columbia products. i think their stuff is every bit as good, and better in some cases, than the higher priced brands that seem to be more fashion focused. that said, i have been harsh towards columbia in my reviews when need be. i had a different vest of theirs that was so heavy and uncomfortable that it was unwearable and i returned it asap. had still another that was made well, but the sizing was way off and it was far, far too long.now, about this vest. i love it!i wanted something lighter to wear over flannels or other baselayers and had tried another brand that my wife had purchased for me. it was ok, but i didn't like the way it fit around the chest area and the pockets were a bit odd. i know that sounds nitpicky, but putting your hands in that vest's pockets was awkward due to the angle. as a result i told my wife i was going to order this columbia vest and see how it worked out.after the columbia arrived it took me maybe a minute to tell my wife she could return the other vest she had purchased. the columbia just felt better in the way it fit. it also cost less than half what the other one did and that is always nice as well. the material of this vest is very soft, thus the title of my review, and although it is quite comfortable it seems quite durable as well. the warmth is what you would expect of a light to mid weight vest. i have worn it on some drizzly days outside and it seems to shed water decently as well. ideally you would wear a rain jacket over it on days that are going to be wet, but i think this vest would do just fine in light rain for a while before it soaked through.i like the vest so much i'm going to order two more in different colors. great job columbia!

"34",34,"mens jackets","columbia","richard d.","        columbia does not disappoint with the quality of their vests! though this may seem like the entry-level vest for them, it's functionally served me well with it's multitude of pockets. heck, having pockets itself is a huge plus for a vest. you can't expect it to take you through a snowstorm but the fleece that they use in their vests are soft, modestly warm and feel quality to the touch. my only qualm is that it's a bit long for a vest, but i am quite a short person so i can't say that i didn't expect this, but it still serves its purpose!

"37",37,"mens jackets","columbia","omar siddique","        a surprisingly good fit on this lightweight vest.i'm an odd (men's) size somewhere l and xl for most tops, so a lot of things are either tight or baggy. this one (l) is just right for me for outdoor active wear-- fitted but not snug. i could easily wear a couple of tee-shirts or one heavier top underneath. the shoulders come out a little further than i expected (more than they do on the model), so paired with a shorter-sleeved tee may look funny.the material is lightweight (thinner than i expected) but feels warm. this is definitely active-wear or for mildly cool temperatures, it won't keep you warm in frigid temps except as one of multiple layers. a good choice when it's too warm to be active with a long-sleeved jacket, but too cool to skip a heavier layer. for me, this is a hiking vest.recommended.

"92",92,"mens shorts","tommy hilfiger men's smooth lamb","chad","        great faux leather jacket!  the style is classic, yet modern, timeless, casual and very cool.  high quality and very well crafted/constructed.i am 5'11"", 208lbs, 36"" waist, athletic build, jacket size 42r, shirt size 17.5 34/35.  i ordered a size large and it fits perfectly.the stand up collar adds an distinct edge of coolness, but the jacket is not so trendy that you have to worry about it ever going out of fashion.  while it is a casual jacket it could also easily be worn for a dressier night out too.the soft fabric stretchy waist and cuffs along with the quality lining make it really comfortable.  the same soft fabric also lines the neck so the faux leather doesn't stick or cause your neck to sweat like with other leather and faux-leather jackets where the material touches your skin.there is absolutely no way you can tell it is a faux jacket...none.  it looks and feels just like lambskin leather.  my wife had no clue it was a faux leather jacket until i told her.  she is having me return the $700 real leather jacket i recently bought and keep this quality alternative in it's place...and at 10 times the savings ;)  ","verified purchase","2016-11-08",5

"97",97,"mens shorts","tommy hilfiger men's smooth lamb","a. hearn","        this jacket met or exceeded my expectations. i bought it based on the reviews found here and am not disappointed. indeed, the finish is almost impossible to determine that it's not real leather, in both feel and appearance. the tag says it is water resistant.i am 6'1"", 197 lbs, average build, and ordered the large size which fits perfectly. sleeve length is just right, which is always a concern when i'm buying a jacket. it fits snuggly when zipped up and probably wouldn't work well with a heavy sweater -- but that's not the way i'll be using it. it's just a bit heavier than i expected, being faux leather, but not nearly as heavy and bulky as real leather.i don't particularly care for the bright checkered pattern on the inside liner, but it won't be seen by anyone when i'm wearing it.  i would have preferred a dark solid color. however, this in no way detracts from my overall satisfaction with this purchase.

"160",160,"mens shorts","dickies men's insulated eisenhower jacket","james jameson","        so this is my 3rd dickies jacket in this style. i am used to the fit, and knew what to expect when ordering, so there were no surprises here. this is the insulated version, so it is a little warmer than the cheaper non insulated version. do yourself a favor and choose this one over the non insulated version. the non insulated jacket is no warmer than a thin flannel shirt. this one actually holds in some heat. this is by no means a heavy jacket, however. im a skinny guy, so i get cold in the 60s and 70s. this jacket provides enough warmth for me down to the 40s. but in the 60s, if i'm working/moving around, it actually gets a bit hot.so, yes it is a ""light"" jacket, but not so light that it wont do any good in the 40s and 50s. also it's not too heavy (in my opinion) for temperatures in the 60s.the lining is like a polyester type, very smooth and feels good on the arms. i prefer this to cotton or wool type linings. this is only preference, but just thought you should know, in case you prefer the more cotton type lining.so the fitment is probably what you are most curious about. this style of jacket is short and meant to be more fitted than other jackets. the sleeves come to your wrist (with average arm length). the bottom of the jacket stops at the waist, maybe slightly above depending on your torso length. if you're wearing the correct size jacket, when you move, this jacket may feel ""too small"" for you. meaning the sleeves will come above your wrists when stretching your arms, or the bottom will rise above your waist line. you will feel it slightly constricting shoulder movement. if this is what you want, then order the correct size. if you prefer a little more breathing/movement room, then order the next size up.just for reference, i'm 5'11"" 145 pounds, fairly skinny. i wear a small in most jackets, small-medium t-shirts, small work shirts/uniform shirts. but i don't like baggy shirts and jackets. so a small in this dickies jacket is perfect for me. if you are about the size of me, and prefer more fitted shirts and jackets, then the small should be good for you. if you like them more baggy, then go with the medium.this theory should work across the spectrum in all the sizes. if you like fitted coats, then get the size you would normally get. if you like them more loose and baggy, then get the next size up.all in all this is a great buy on a very durable jacket. i work on cars for a living so this jacket gets daily use and abuse throughout the fall and winter. even with all the abuse, i still get a few years out of these jackets. that's not to say they are worn out after a few years, they just get so stained and faded, it's time to get a new one. but at this price point, you could get a couple at a time, and wear them forever.oh an one more thing. if you're looking at other work jackets on amazon, you may notice many of them say the proportions are all screwed up...like oversized arms or torso areas. weird proportions that make you like popeye or something. the dickies jacket is not like that. if you get the correct size, you will not look weird like you may with other brand jackets.

( i couldn't tell because the front still seemed big  in the gut area ) . ---- i still like the jacket overall .  the price is good as well . if the denim was thicker no doubt this jacket would be selling for $100 some odd dollars , right ?---  ","verified purchase","2015-10-22",4

"427",427,"mens shorts","wrangler men's rustic sherpa lined jacket","pf","        the jacket is great, but amazon really let us down this time.  first, the jacket: it fit well (xl for someone who normally wears that size) and is much closer in weight and styling to the very old favorite one being replaced than we expected.  like the old one, it has sizing buttons on the waist, one good open interior chest pocket, and good side pockets.  the outer chest pockets are much smaller in both width and height (just barely wide enough for a smart phone but not tall enough to close over one) and have sturdy snaps instead of buttons - we'll see how these hold up.  the sleeves have one snap instead of a button.  i would give 5 stars if the chest pockets weren't so small.now for amazon:  we ordered this jacket prime for a particular need and it took six calendar days to get here.  what?  normally our items (and we order a lot) come ups and arrive like clockwork.  happy customer.  this one came fedex and the tracking notes are very interesting, starting with ""processed by shipper and loaded in trailer said to contain package"".  then the regular status continues showing it took 6 days, including going from california to portland and then back to us in southern oregon.  we don't know if the fault was amazon's or fedex's, but either way, what is the remedy for this failure of service for our prime membership?  either way, amazon, please go back to using ups!!

(i want to freeze this or use ultra cold water).  if you don't, it gets a very humid feeling, at least for me in a warehouse where temps average 90degrees plus right now.the more you soak it, the better it is.  the colder the water is, the better it is.it does feel heavy.. but only at first.  you get used to it quickly and appreciate the lower temp feeling.  it has made quite a difference in my quality of life chart working in a warehouse.  i wish we used these for all employees.i am happy with my purchase and do recommend it to others with a few cautions as explained above.tho it does feel a bit like wearing a wet t-shirt at times.4/5 stars.

"1054",1054,"mens shorts","ergodyne chill-its evaporative cooling vest","kimmoj","        maybe the problem is my expectations, but having never bought cooling gear before i expected a bit more. what i received was a vest that says it has polyester and cotton in it in the materials tag on the vest. there's no mention of pva anywhere, and i realize now that the ""activated polymer inside"" doesn't actually specify what type of plastic they talk about in this vest.so, essentially, this is a cotton t-shirt wrapped in a layer of plastic on the outside.the expectation was that it would soak in water to its core and leave the surface at most clammy. this thing is soaking wet on the outside even after you wring it dry after immersion, and the water flows down and when the top is dry-ish, the hem is dripping. so, i can only assume this isn't in any way a ""high-tech"" vest with pva that soaks up a lot of water and slowly releases it to get the cooling effect.. it's a bog standard cotton-polyester vest that you can soak in water.i bought a chill-its hat alongside this. that clearly states it does have pva in the sweatband. and the sweatband in the hat is clearly different to the vest - it's cold and somewhat clammy feeling without feeling wet. that is what i expected from the vest, but this vest appears to have none of this more unusual material in it, making it lower tech and i suppose mildly better than just wearing a wet t-shirt. disappointing. it will cool you down, i'm sure, but at the cost of also soaking through your clothing most likely caveat emptor.

"1397",1397,"mens shorts","gihuo men's golf lightweight photo vest fishing travel safari vest","bangorbill","        this review refers specifically to the basic model with three outside zipper pockets.  i placed four orders to finally get one of acceptable size.  i wear size l for shirts, vests and jackets of almost all brands. i ordered this guiho vest in size l and received a size s in a package labeled l; the size tag had been cut out.  i ordered l again (in a different color) and received size m in a package labeled l; again no size tag.  a size xxl was too big.  finally a size xl was satisfactory, though a bit too large.  so i have not seen a true size l.  both the xxl and the xl had size tags.  i think the seller ran out of size l and so deceptively put smaller sizes in packages labeled l. colors are not as pictured: the “army green” is an ugly dark greenish brown; kakhi is more yellowish brown than shown, but satisfactory.  the overall quality seems satisfactory, though i have not yet tested it for durability.  it is annoying that the zipper pull is on the left side.  the one inside pocket in the xl is barely big enough to hold a us passport; pockets are smaller in smaller sizes.  follow up:  the vest gave satisfactory service for a week of traveling abroad.  my main complaint is about the deceptive sizing.  it could be improved by adding a large inside pocket big enough to carry a kindle or a travel guide book.

"1751",1751,"mens shorts","wrangler men's regular blanket lined denim jacket","fred rubble","        the purchase of this jacket was one of my best-researched, but still worrying purchases. as it's not available from wrangler au i had to order in from wrangler us. there are many lined denim or corduroy jackets about, but sizing varies considerably amongst the various brands. i currently own no wrangler jackets to compare the new one with, and having two choices in xl (46 & 48) was slightly confusing, but welcome. my main worry was whether i needed 46 (slightly larger than my nominal chest size) or 48 to allow for layering. i ordered 46 and it was an extremely anxious (and rather long) wait for it to arrive. it fits well, the 48 would have been too big. having recently bought an unlined jacket in xxl from a different company, which was too small for anything but summer shirts underneath, i was very relieved.i noted comments in reviews about the buttons and concur with those complaints- the button holes are indeed poorly executed  and very tight when new. one of the sizing issues i had was whether my arms would feel constricted with the lining. many lined jackets do not extend the lining to the arms. even with winter clothes on i could get my arms in fine with this jacket, and allowance in sizing appears to have been made for the blanket lining. i noted comments about plain grey blanket lining but mine is the red/grey mix as per product photos.the price was reasonable and compared favourably with wrangler jackets available in australia. indeed, amazon's price was a little better than wrangler's own when usd was converted to aud, with free shipping. my only minor complaint with this jacket would be that it looks a little too ""western"" for this urban cowboy, but it is after all a wrangler.the jacket looks great with the corduroy collar, preferable to either plain denim or fake sheepskin, and the blanket lining is more attractive than other wrangler jackets which have bright red plaid flannel or the aforementioned ""sherpa"", or fake sheepskin. overall i'm very pleased with this jacket, and can add to my collection of countries of manufacture for later ""us"" goods, for this jacket was made in nicaragua. it certainly beats ""made in china"".

"1986",1986,"mens shorts","columbia men's cathedral peak","oc doc","        i bought this vest as a ""spare"" to keep at the office. here in southern california, spring and autumn days can feel deceptively warm, only to cool down quickly to 60 f or below after dark. i have a habit of forgetting to bring any outerwear with me to the office, except in winter, and then wishing i had something light to wear for warmth if going straight from the office to a meeting or dinner or other social engagement. in this climate, a fleece vest passes for ""outerwear"" for all but the three coldest months. i have an older element red vest from columbia, received as a gift many years ago, which has stood the test of time, so i thought i'd order columbia again.cost is reasonable for quality and priced perhaps 20-25% less than the famous outfitter from freeport, maine charges for its equivalent product. fabric is soft and comfortable, not scratchy. detailing is nice with two zip pockets, a collar that may be worn flat or straight up, and a hanger loop---a feature that my old columbia vest lacks. fit tends to be a half size larger than usual, so that my large feels halfway between l and xl. if you want a trim fit, consider one size smaller than you usually order. on the other hand, if you want to layer it over a thermal top or sweater, buy your usual size and you'll appreciate the fuller than usual cut. another plus is that it's offered in a dozen different colors, which again presents more choices than the competitor from freeport.

"2487",2487,"mens shorts","red kap men's slash pocket jacket, navy, small","trencher","        i received my first jacket at my job. 7 years of being my go to jacket, it has been great spring and fall. winter time on top of a nice hoodie and thermal shirt, you're good to go.not overly thick but that's what i like most. it is still plenty warm and blocks wind and light rain. it is comfortable enough to become my cats favorite nap spot so i'll take her word on that.for 7 years of use, i still use it, have only had to replace 2 plastic buttons over the years, both on right sleeve which i use more, so that's understandable. plenty of other buttons on jacket you don't really need so use one of those for the important one if it breaks. i wash it in washing machine and dry in dryer, nothing fancy just throw it in with other clothes. it is actually remarkable how well it has held up, which inspired me to order my own without the work insignia or my name sewn on. and in a color i wanted. i checked the label on my work coat, saw red kap, and started my amazon search to find the right one (slash pocket jacket) i already knew a large fit me perfect (6' 0"" 165lbs) and honestly the price was about 1/3 of what i expected, as it has outlasted way pricier jackets (carhartt).  only improvement would be a zipper pocket on the inside since slash pockets have a habit of spilling my phone but i can work around that. redd kap has gained a faithful fan, may not buy too much since they last so long, but will recommend to anyone anytime. heck, look at the photos, blue is 7 years old and grey is my new one. almost no difference after a lot of use.
