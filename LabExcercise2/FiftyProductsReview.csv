    I returned this as neither my wife nor I could easily get the zip to start.  As you need to re-join the zip each time you wear it this would be a major inconvenience.  In general, I thought the quality of the garment was poorer than I expected for the price.

    This is the 3rd Columbia vest that my husband owns. It is the perfect weight, has lots of pockets for storage - cell phone, pens, business cards, even wallets. The owner of this vest actually said, ""It's kind of like a purse - you can keep so much in it that you need for the day.""It comes in many colors, is suitable for the washer and the dryer, and it matches so many things.I highly recommend this garment.

    Great spring / fall vest.  Not too thick so nice and light.  I have other fleece vests (North Face), and fine that in the warmer spring weather, they get too warm.  The is a great vest for spring weather.Fit is as expected.  I am a 48 chest size, and wear suits that are 48R.  The Extra Large is loose and comfortable, and if you prefer snug, then go Large.Material and workmanship is spot on for a reputable company like Columbia.  No stitching problems, and zipper is top notch.No complaints here, and highly recommend this product.

    First off, I love Columbia products. I think their stuff is every bit as good, and better in some cases, than the higher priced brands that seem to be more fashion focused. That said, I have been harsh towards Columbia in my reviews when need be. I had a different vest of theirs that was so heavy and uncomfortable that it was unwearable and I returned it ASAP. Had still another that was made well, but the sizing was way off and it was far, far too long.Now, about this vest. I love it!I wanted something lighter to wear over flannels or other baselayers and had tried another brand that my wife had purchased for me. It was ok, but I didn't like the way it fit around the chest area and the pockets were a bit odd. I know that sounds nitpicky, but putting your hands in that vest's pockets was awkward due to the angle. As a result I told my wife I was going to order this Columbia vest and see how it worked out.After the Columbia arrived it took me maybe a minute to tell my wife she could return the other vest she had purchased. The Columbia just felt better in the way it fit. It also cost less than half what the other one did and that is always nice as well. The material of this vest is very soft, thus the title of my review, and although it is quite comfortable it seems quite durable as well. The warmth is what you would expect of a light to mid weight vest. I have worn it on some drizzly days outside and it seems to shed water decently as well. Ideally you would wear a rain jacket over it on days that are going to be wet, but I think this vest would do just fine in light rain for a while before it soaked through.I like the vest so much I'm going to order two more in different colors. Great job Columbia!

    Columbia does not disappoint with the quality of their vests! Though this may seem like the entry-level vest for them, it's functionally served me well with it's multitude of pockets. Heck, having pockets itself is a huge plus for a vest. You can't expect it to take you through a snowstorm but the fleece that they use in their vests are soft, modestly warm and feel quality to the touch. My only qualm is that it's a bit long for a vest, but I am quite a short person so I can't say that I didn't expect this, but it still serves its purpose!

    A surprisingly good fit on this lightweight vest.I'm an odd (men's) size somewhere L and XL for most tops, so a lot of things are either tight or baggy. This one (L) is just right for me for outdoor active wear-- fitted but not snug. I could easily wear a couple of tee-shirts or one heavier top underneath. The shoulders come out a little further than I expected (more than they do on the model), so paired with a shorter-sleeved tee may look funny.The material is lightweight (thinner than I expected) but feels warm. This is definitely active-wear or for mildly cool temperatures, it won't keep you warm in frigid temps except as one of multiple layers. A good choice when it's too warm to be active with a long-sleeved jacket, but too cool to skip a heavier layer. For me, this is a hiking vest.Recommended.

    Non mi è piaciuto il fatto che nelle foto c'era il marchio Columbia ricamato sul petto e invece sul prodotto non c'era nulla, Columbia era scritto solo in una etichetta interna. Devo dire che mi puzza un po di fake, mi dispiace perchè se volevo prendere un prodotto anonimo prodotto in Bangladesh probabilmente potevo risparmiare dei soldi. Alla fine comunque il prodotto è discreto, niente di più. Veste piuttosto abbondante, se siete a cavallo di due taglie vi suggerisco di prendere quella più piccola.

    I am a 43 y.o. ""big and tall"" female. This men's big and tall 3x vest fits me perfectly and I especially love the longer length. Columbia clothing runs small and the women's 3x fits fine in the front except it's too short. It's a shame they don't make big and tall in women's. I ordered 2 charcoal grey vests, they are a definite staple and I wear them often. Columbia is a great company with excellent quality clothing.

    I am nearly 6'5"" tall and about 190lbs and the large fit me like a glove the sleeves come up a little short when my hands aren't perfectly by my sides, but at my height that's a normal thing.Also very rare for me to find something so long that isn't a swimming pool in the body. I usually have to take all my clothing purchases straight to my tailor. But not this jacket!Overall it looks fantastic and is comfortable for faux leather thanks to its lining.Ended up purchasing the brown one after and gave this navy one to a friend as the blue was too similar to my jeans.

    I have been looking for a leather jacket for some time. Bought a few products from Amazon and tried others in stores and all of them came with insanely long sleeves. Superman sleeves. And because its leather, a tailor cannot just fix it.Finally, I bought this Tommy Hilfiger leather jacket and I surprised to see it's true to size and its sleeves are normal. At first I wasn't thrilled about it because of the internal white-blue pattern thing, non-leather ends on the sleeves and belly. But after wearing it, I can confirm it's a great leather jacket.It is warm, without defects or bad areas, and it looks great. And best of all, it actually fits normal people with regular arms.

    This is a good imitation leather jacket for spring and fall and maybe cool summer evenings.  It looks good and is comfortable.  Mine is the dark brown and it looks great.  Collar and cuffs are good.  Very happy with it.  A size-large is just right for me.  I'm 5-10, 200lbs.  Just remember this is really for casual wear.  It's not real leather, so it isn't for real rugged work in harsh conditions in the woods or something like that, and it's not going to be good and tough for a lot of motorcycle or ATV wear or things along those lines.  But if, like me, you're looking for a casual wear leather type jacket at a very good price then this fits the bill.

    I read many reviews to figure out what size I should get and all the reviews helped me decide.My stats are: 6'1"" tall; 220# weight; 36-38 waist;  44-46 chest.  I workout so my arms and shoulders are bigger than normal.  I ordered size XL and it all fit great as if it was made for me.  Some jackets I have are either too lengthy than I'd like them to be, too small or tight in the arms and shoulders or just too much room that the jacket hangs down.  But the XL gives just enough room with a shirt inside and the bottom just falls no more than an inch below the waist which is what I want.The quality of the jacket is very impressive.  I have a Bomber jacket (filled) which cost me almost $200 and its a great jacket for winter only.  The collar holds its form well.  Inside lining feels great.  Wear it throughout most of the year except summer.  Versatile to use as dress up or down.My only con is the packaging.  The item is loose in the package and to think that it's leather, regardless of what type, Amazon should at least fold the jacket loosely to a cardboard then the clear plastic bag before placing it in the mailing bag.

    I ordered a size larger in this because I wanted a looser fit, and it fits just how I wanted it too. I would say if you want it to fit perfect definitely order your normal size. This jacket is nice and warm as well which I love. At first it had a weird smell but now I think that it has loosened up a bit and smells normal now.

    I loved this leather jacket. I usually have a hard time finding the right fit for my body, but this jacket fits just right.  It feels really comfy and warm in this winter weather.  And the price is not as high as you’d expect for a leather jacket.  ***HOWEVER, the fabric around the neck started to fall apart after only a few times of wearing it.  This really gave me the impression of very poor quality materials on this Jacket.  That may explain the low price in it. Overall a nice jacket but made of poor materials.  I returned it for a refund.

    Great faux leather jacket!  The style is classic, yet modern, timeless, casual and very cool.  High quality and very well crafted/constructed.I am 5'11"", 208lbs, 36"" waist, athletic build, jacket size 42R, shirt size 17.5 34/35.  I ordered a size Large and it fits perfectly.The stand up collar adds an distinct edge of coolness, but the jacket is not so trendy that you have to worry about it ever going out of fashion.  While it is a casual jacket it could also easily be worn for a dressier night out too.The soft fabric stretchy waist and cuffs along with the quality lining make it really comfortable.  The same soft fabric also lines the neck so the faux leather doesn't stick or cause your neck to sweat like with other leather and faux-leather jackets where the material touches your skin.There is absolutely no way you can tell it is a faux jacket...none.  It looks and feels just like lambskin leather.  My wife had no clue it was a faux leather jacket until I told her.  She is having me return the $700 real leather jacket I recently bought and keep this quality alternative in it's place...and at 10 times the savings ;)

    This jacket is made of a faux lamb skin, which is a nice supple and soft leather-like material. It flexes, unlike real leather, so it's more comfortable. It's the right weight for a nice fall/spring jacket. It looks good on and the fit is as expected. Remember this is faux leather, so not as tough as the real thing, so don't jump on the motorcycle and think it's going to protect you. For a fashion statement though, it does the job.

    This jacket met or exceeded my expectations. I bought it based on the reviews found here and am not disappointed. Indeed, the finish is almost impossible to determine that it's not real leather, in both feel and appearance. The tag says it is water resistant.I am 6'1"", 197 lbs, average build, and ordered the Large size which fits perfectly. Sleeve length is just right, which is always a concern when I'm buying a jacket. It fits snuggly when zipped up and probably wouldn't work well with a heavy sweater -- but that's not the way I'll be using it. It's just a bit heavier than I expected, being faux leather, but not nearly as heavy and bulky as real leather.I don't particularly care for the bright checkered pattern on the inside liner, but it won't be seen by anyone when I'm wearing it.  I would have preferred a dark solid color. However, this in no way detracts from my overall satisfaction with this purchase.

    Die Jacke sieht super aus und ich hätte sie liebend gerne getragen, allerdings fällt sie in Größe XXL wie eine L aus. Vorne geht die Jacke zwar zu und die Ärmel sind lang genug, allerdings wäre die Jacke in kleine Stücke zerrissen, hätte ich nur einmal kurz die Muskeln angespannt. Dieses schicke Kleidungsstück, ist also eher für sehr drahtige Personen mit äußerst schmalen Schultern und wenig Muskulatur geeignet.

    Da ich bisher keine einzige ""richtige"" Übergangsjacke Frühjahr/Herbst hatte, sondern nur Sweatshirtjacken trug, bestellte ich diese Jacke in Größe L. Da ich Größe M habe, wollte ich sicher gehen, dass die Jacke auch nicht zu kurz, eng sitzt. Sie kam ohne viel Verpackungsmüll an. Die Jacke selbst war in Folienverpackung gelegt und das Ganze in einem Papierumschlag. Kein zusätzlicher Karton. Finde ich gut.Die Jacke selbst schaut aus wie angegeben und sitzt perfekt.Die Jacke hat 3 Reißverschlusstaschen. 2 rechts und links unten und 1 Tasche mit Reißverschluss am oberen linken Ärmel. Daneben befinden sich 4 Täschchen, wo man z.B. einen Stift reinstecken kann. Diese Öffnungen sind klein. Die unteren zwei Taschen sind groß genug, um z.Bsp. Schlüsselbund oder ein Handy (Bsp. Samsung A51) leicht zu verstauen. Innentaschen gibt es keine, das ist für mich auch nicht wichtig, da die Außentaschen für mich ausreichend sind.Alles in allem bin ich sehr zufrieden und würde diese Jacke wieder kaufen, z.Bsp. in einer anderen Farbe.

    Da ich momentan sehr auf den Bomberjackenstil abfahre, habe ich beim günstigen Angebot dieser Jacke natürlich gleich zu geschlagen. Ander als bei Bomberjacken von Alpha oder Urban Classic ist diese Jacke nicht aus Nylon, sondern aus Polyester, was der Jacke einen fast samtartigen Stoff verleiht. Auch ist das Jäckchen, recht dünn, ungefüttert, aber mit verstärkter Innenseite und damit perfekt für die Übergangstage Frühling/Herbst geeignet. Eine Innentasche gibt es leider nicht, dafür aber die bombertypische Armtasche mit Reissverschluss am linken Arm.Ich habe diese Jacke im dezenten hellblau, was modisch heraussticht. Lässt sich diese Farbe doch wunderbar mit einem gelben T-Hemd oder grauen Strickpulli kombinieren und wirkt noch dazu wunderbar elegant!Ich kann nur eine bedenkenlose Empfehlung aussprechen. Denkt daran, wenn ihr nicht ganz so schlank seid, lieber eine Nummer Größer zu bestellen, Bomber fallen nunmal recht klein aus. Diese hier passte mir in M aber perfekt bei 178 cm und 65 kg.

    Partner is 6 foot and on the skinnier side. The size medium fits him well. Good length, covers back when you sit and fits well with some room to move. The sleeves are slightly long but the with the cuff rolled up once it fits well. Good quality, lined and waterproof.

    I am about 6""1 and 95kg. I wear a large everything. I ordered a LR. I pulled the waist in with the straps, and the jacket fit is great. Only problem is have is that the arms seems quite long proportionate to the rest. Realistically I probably could have fit a medium, I think. Overall pretty happy with the product.

    So this is my 3rd Dickies jacket in this style. I am used to the fit, and knew what to expect when ordering, so there were no surprises here. This is the insulated version, so it is a little warmer than the cheaper non insulated version. Do yourself a favor and choose this one over the non insulated version. The non insulated jacket is no warmer than a thin flannel shirt. This one actually holds in some heat. This is by no means a heavy jacket, however. Im a skinny guy, so I get cold in the 60s and 70s. This jacket provides enough warmth for me down to the 40s. But in the 60s, if I'm working/moving around, it actually gets a bit hot.So, yes it is a ""light"" jacket, but not so light that it wont do any good in the 40s and 50s. Also it's not too heavy (in my opinion) for temperatures in the 60s.The lining is like a polyester type, very smooth and feels good on the arms. I prefer this to cotton or wool type linings. This is only preference, but just thought you should know, in case you prefer the more cotton type lining.So the fitment is probably what you are most curious about. This style of jacket is short and meant to be more fitted than other jackets. The sleeves come to your wrist (with average arm length). The bottom of the jacket stops at the waist, maybe slightly above depending on your torso length. If you're wearing the correct size jacket, when you move, this jacket may feel ""too small"" for you. Meaning the sleeves will come above your wrists when stretching your arms, or the bottom will rise above your waist line. You will feel it slightly constricting shoulder movement. If this is what you want, then order the correct size. If you prefer a little more breathing/movement room, then order the next size UP.Just for reference, I'm 5'11"" 145 pounds, fairly skinny. I wear a small in most jackets, small-medium t-shirts, small work shirts/uniform shirts. But I don't like baggy shirts and jackets. So a small in this Dickies jacket is perfect for me. If you are about the size of me, and prefer more fitted shirts and jackets, then the small should be good for you. If you like them more baggy, then go with the medium.This theory should work across the spectrum in all the sizes. If you like fitted coats, then get the size you would normally get. If you like them more loose and baggy, then get the next size up.All in all this is a great buy on a very durable jacket. I work on cars for a living so this jacket gets daily use and abuse throughout the fall and winter. Even with all the abuse, I still get a few years out of these jackets. That's not to say they are worn out after a few years, they just get so stained and faded, it's time to get a new one. But at this price point, you could get a couple at a time, and wear them forever.Oh an one more thing. If you're looking at other work jackets on Amazon, you may notice many of them say the proportions are all screwed up...Like oversized arms or torso areas. Weird proportions that make you like Popeye or something. The Dickies jacket IS NOT like that. If you get the correct size, you will not look weird like you may with other brand jackets.

    Qualità prezzo del giubbotto Dickies indiscutibile. Ho ordinato il colore grigio, dove sipuò abbinare con un pantalone nero o blue. La giacca è resistente all'acqua, all'interno ha un'imbottitura ed è calda. Consiglio di controllare prima dell'acquisto la taglia,  poiché il taglio è americano e potrebbe risultare molto più grande. Spedizione Amazon ottima.Aggiornando la recensione ad oggi 31 gennaio, il giubbotto in questione usandolo con temperature sotto lo zero è risultato molto caldo e molto resistente all'acqua/neve.

However, be aware of the collar and cuffs - the collar is wide, and the cuff is long - by my measurement, it's 3 inches in length. If you can overlook that, then you'll be happy with it. I know I am.

    I am using this jacket when working on a Farm and it is performing very good. Dirt, water*, mud... whatever the jacket is exposed to it can take it protects me well. Also the built quality is very good, nothing seems to tear or rip even when the fabric gets stressed. (*When it comes to water it protects, but it still also absorbs the water, so the jacket is not really fully water repellent, it still needs to dry off if it got really ""soaked"" in water). When it comes to sizing, I am almost 6ft. tall and chubby, so the 2XL size option is the one for me. The jacket sits just a tiny bit lose this way, but for me that is very comfortable.

    Classic design and built to last. The fit is on point. Amazon recommended a small, but I went with a medium. I think a small one would have been too snug. I was initially worried that the sleeves would be too long/big, but the length and size are just right. The sleeves rest slightly below my wrist but do not cover my whole hand.

    HElly Hansen es una gran firma de ropa deportiva, con tejidos de calidad.Sin embargo, no esperes una maravilla en este modelo de chaleco. Decidi comprarlo porque lo conocia, pero no me esperaba lo mala que es la cremallera y lo mal diseñados que estan los bolsillos. SOlo dispone de los laterales de mano, con cremallera, y de dos interiores algo más grandes. El gran problema es que ambos coinciden en altura a la altura de la cintura, y como el tejido es poco rigido, se deformará quedando rarisimo.Por algo mas de precio tienes un modelo de polar con acabado rígido y aspecto de neopreno que si que esta bien.

    This vest is mostly as advertised. I am 5'10"" 200lbs and ordered an XL.The pockets' inner mesh is not as warm as fleece lined pockets but still keeps hands warm enough. The zipper is somehow really easy to use yet still doesn't unzip, and has no sharp edges. The collar is super soft with the zip all the way up and does not catch my scruffy beard.I suspected it would be a ""slim fit"" which is why I ordered an XL. The armpit holes are a little tight but not too much. I think the vest would have been too tight if I got just a Large.

    Nice enough vest which will perform adequately, but two warnings .......The vest is very thin, (very little filling) so I would say suitable for mildly cool days only.Also this is not a normal or slim fit, but generous in sizing, so you can wear over thick jumpers..It would be helpful when ordering if the description included ""RELAXED FIT"" as per the attached label.

    Chaleco delgado, calentito y de uso rudo. Hace poco conocí esta marca y me han gustado mucho sus productos, son costosos, posiblemente el doble o triple de lo que cuesta un chaleco similar en marca X, pero este chaleco se nota me va a durar muuuchos años.El año pasado compré un chaleco columbia muy similar tanto en estilo, prestaciones y precio, el columbia me salió muy bueno pero comparando con el carhartt me quedo con este, el material se ve mucho más resistente, repelente al agua y algo q es un plus para mi es que es 2 o 3 cm más corto,  no me gustan los chalecos largos.Mido 170cm peso 92kg el mediano me queda un poquito apretado, pero me da justo chance de traer una camisa de franela o polar delgada abajo del chaleco.Lo compré a muy buen precio ($1,097)

    Die Weste ist geil! Leider habe ich sie mir erst in M bestellt und war hin und hergerissen ob sie mir passt oder zu groß ist. Ich habe sie dann umgetauscht (Vorsicht und beachten, die rücksende kosten musste ich selbst tragen.  Ein direkter Umtausch wurde mir nicht angeboten. Dadurch habe ich bei der neubestellung 2 €mehr gezahlt + die Rücksendung.) Als ich sie dann in S anprobiert habe dachte ich kurz sie wäre evtl. doch zu klein. Aber nein sie ist slim und passt perfekt. Da zu sieht sie gut aus und ist praktisch. Die Taschen sind gut plaziert und über all vorhanden. Brust Seiten und Innentasche. Top! Eindeutig eine Kauf Empfehlung. Allerdings ist es keine Weste für extreme Arbeitsbelastung oder um sich durch Büsche und dornenstreucher zu bewegen ;)

    This is a great Carhartt vest.  It is a large and I am 6'1"" / 185 lbs and it fits just right over a sweatshirt.  Anyone bigger would probably need the XL.  Also it has pulls to tighten the bottom at waist to keep wind out.  Two zipper pockets - one on outside and one on inside.  Also velcro pocket on inside.Carhartt makes great clothing.  Almost everything I wear is from them.

    I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas. The vest fits nicely, except it kicks out at the bottom in the back when he wears it. (That's what I dislike the most.) Most of his problems with the vest involve the openings to the pockets which are hard for him to get into if there is anything in his hand to put into the pocket. I think the openings are a little small for a larger man. He says the fabric is a little slick!  (I fear all remarks are tainted by his previous vest, which he liked very much and left somewhere. Next year I will get him sticks!)

    This is a great jacket, and a 8/10 design but it's lacking in the most necessary feature. I ended up buying the 5.11 version instead because it was extremely lightweight, rolls up into a ball and yet probably 4x warmer. However, this jacket had the better pockets, and arguably I like the horizontal stitching look better. Make the arms have a nice sinch mechanism, and use the special insulation in the 5.11 jacket and I think you'll be on top. The neck fabric is a little rough. I'd prefer a Sherpa or maybe micro rabbit hair feel, but it's not a deal breaker. Also, keep the XLT sizing please, extra cost isn't an issue, for whatever reason all men's clothing is either for a 1950s man, or women these days and never fits right. The XLT is about the same length as the default 5.11 XL.

    It's hard to find clothes that fit my 6' 5"" frame, but this jacket fits great! It does the job of being a windbreaker. But what I like the most is that it folds down into a small bag that's hidden in one of the pockets. I keep it in the trunk of my car so I'll always have a jacket handy if I'm unexpectedly caught in the cold while out and about.

    This was suppose to be a 2X Mans. I buy 2X clothes all the time a normal large is tight on me this was even tighter than that. I don't know if this was miss marked or what I could just verily smash myself into it I am very disappointed. I own many Hanes tie shirts and sweat shirts that are 2X no problems that is why I  think this might be missed marked. I don't feel like I want to go through this again without trying it on before buying. You have to pay return shipping on this so don't buy this unless you are sure that is will fit and this is a retailor apart from amazon so this cost me something like 9 dollars to try this on.

    I took a chance an am so happy I did! I'm a very busty lady triple D to be exact. Most coats never fit right because of this. I ordered the teal pullover jacket in a men's XL. It has adjustable waist strap an hood strap. It also folds into its own front pocket. So it's easy to put in my purse an travel with. Though the teal was more of a blue, I'm ok with that! In fact I love it even more. It also shipped fast. Thx so much.

    Have been looking for a lightweight rain jacket for golf at a reasonable price.  Tried a couple of more expensive ones and wasn't real happy with them, it seems you either get lightweight or only water resistant, not waterproof.  This one advertises water resistant but I was impressed with the material and expect it will hold up to a decent downpour.  I have not had a chance to test it yet but the fabric is better than what I was expecting.  I am normally a medium size for most things but ordered a large for this given I will use it for golf and the fit is great.  It is lightweight and does not restrict movement.  Not a fan of the brand logo on the chest but if all goes well I will only wear it a few times a year.

    I bought this jacket for my 14 years old son.  He has worn it throughout fall 2020 and is already wearing it again this spring (April 2021).  It is lightweight and very well-made.  It has 2 regular side pockets in the waist area as well as a large zippered front pocket in which the jacket can be folded into.  When wearing the jacket, this extra large pocket is very practical for storing your keys, cellphone, earbuds, and any other personal items.  Even though the fabric is thin, it keeps you warm during cooler windy days.  The quality is good as we have had no issues at all with the fabric ripping.It fits my son nicely and has a little extra space which is great since he can easily wear layers underneath.  It is adjustable at the waist and it is wind and rain repellent.  The hood is also a nice touch and helps keep him dry when he is out and about.  It's stylish, comfortable and the fact that it can be neatly folded into a compact little pouch is definitely a plus.  Great purchase.  Would recommend.If my review was helpful let me know by clicking on the ''Helpful'' button :) 👍🏻

It still looks great, he swears they're comfortable and with as often as he wears them they must be. Highly recommend based on my son's satisfaction with them. They also really look great on as well.  Fit is true to size. I bought the same size I buy him in Nike or champion hoodies.

    Everything is right about this product- fit, quality, size, and price; truly does repel water. The only gripe, and perhaps others would prefer this, is that it really traps all your sweat inside, and you can literally see the entire interior covered in beads of perspiration with (to me) minimal exertion. So if you ever wanted the sauna experience, this jacket has you covered (in sweat).

    We purchased us to utilize for crew in which you have to cinch everything up around the body, and a anorak style jacket is preferred.

    I got an extra large because I like loose and baggy fits. I was really happy that it achieved that look without appearing like I wasn’t swimming in it. Form around the sides is still flattering. Main reason I bought it was for the pocket in the front, it has a zipper on the top and it’s a little bit small but can fit wallet, phone, keys, earbuds, and probably a few more things (even though it will look bulky). Great for traveling. Did get a tiny bit warm in it after wearing it around the house for about 20 minutes which I wasn’t expecting but overall it’s probably the best windbreaker on Amazon.

    I'm 5'11"" about 175 LBS. Typically I fall between a medium and a large. Large usually fits my shoulders pretty well but is a bit baggy around my waist.

But if I  wanted to wear it over something like a sweat shirt, I would have needed a large.

    I bought this top because it was 20 dollars cheaper than the 'starter' jacket of the same style. Material is much lighter than a regular windbreaker and feels more breathable.Arms have a nice range of motion, jacket fits a little slim in the body though. If you are buying this and want to layer anything other than a thermal t-shirt I would suggest ordering a size up.

    I normally wear an XL for snug fit, and a 2XL for comfort fit.Reading the reviews, it is suggested to order one or two sizes LARGER than what the sizing chart suggests.I ordered 3XL and the fit is perfect. Not too loose, just nice. I can do up all the buttons and wear a t-shirt or dress shirt underneath the vest without any issues. 2 outer pockets and 2 inner pockets---one zippered---is just great.Leather is quite heavy...which I like, and the lining simple with no sagging.Works for me!

    Ich bin 176 cm groß und wiege 80 kg (kräftig aber nicht dick). Beeinflusst von den Rezessionen habe ich die Größe XL bestellt (normal L).  Die Jacke war mir zu groß. Höchstens tragbar mit gefütterten Holzfällerhemd.Die Rücksendung mit Amazon QR-Code war Kundenfreundlich, problemlos. Der Händler hat mir umgehend den Erhalt und eine Gutschrift bestätigt.Da die Weste eine sehr gute Leder- und Verarbeitungsqualität hat habe ich sie mir nochmal in Größe L bestellt. Die Zusendung erfolgte zügig und meine Qualitätserwartung wurde nicht enttäuscht. L passt mir, mit normalen Hemd oder T-Shirt, bestens.Die Westenlänge reicht bis zum Hosenbund. Genauso möchte ich den Schnitt. Die Druckknöpfe schließen fest. Das Leder ist kräftig, dadurch wirkt die Weste etwas steif, genauso wie ich es möchte.Fazit: Richtig bestellt (Größe) hat man eine Lederweste an der man viele Jahre Freude hat. Kaufempfehlung!

    J'avais un doute quant au rapport qualité prix mais c'est du vrai cuir! Très bien travaillé bien taillé aucun défaut (les boutons pressions, les finitions, le volume des poches, l'épaisseur du cuir...) je n'en reviens pas. J'ai pris S en me fiant au tableau des tailles et c'est parfait. La doublure polyester est bien finie et le cuir ne fait pas fake en surface, l'odeur est celle d'un cuir de qualité. 2 petites poches extérieures format zip et 2 poches portefeuille à l'intérieur dont une zippée. Magnifique !

    Nice waistcoat and yes it is real leather and it has some nice weight. I bought a large and normally buy medium/large depending. However i am 5ft 10'' in height and have a slender build. If you have a paunch it will not be able to button it closed. I have no paunch and it fits me perfectly. Also has one zip inside pocket and another inside pocket on the other side. Not something you get with waistcoats. A fabulous quality waistcoat for the money.

    I am giving this FIVE stars  because I really like this jacket and the shipping was extremely fast . ---- I did have a couple of concerns though . The first -- I am a pretty big guy . 6 ft tall -- 240 pounds . I was not quite sure of what size to order cause just like everybody else - I hate returning something . Just a hassle !! --- So I followed the size chart and read all the reviews .( I wish that some other folks would of shared with us what their height and weight were in these reviews) . -- Anyway -- My chest is between a size 48 and 50 . -- I settled on the size XL in this jacket . After it arrived I tried it on and it looks great ( without buttoning up ) . When I do button up the jacket , it is very relaxed in the front . I have a nice size gut as well but you would never know wearing this jacket . Plenty of room for a hoodie or thermals or flannels . --- Now -- I don't know if I like that ?!?! I don't want to wear a hooded jacket underneath because I don't think that will look right . If it was a plain collar than yes . But the collar is sherpa-like and that I wouldn't want to obstruct the jackets collar . Does that make any sense ??? -- Another concern of mine was the quality of the denim . ---- I remember having this jacket when i was in my teens ( 3 decades ago ) - and for some reason that jacket seemed a heck of a lot thicker . This denim seems thin . --- OH-- I did wash and dry the day I received it ( I wanted to actually try and shrink it a little ). I don't think it shrunk at all . ( I couldn't tell because the front still seemed big  in the gut area ) . ---- I still like the jacket overall .  The price is good as well . If the denim was thicker no doubt this jacket would be selling for $100 some odd dollars , right ?---

    I had high hopes for this being a Wrangler jacket, but it fell short of what I was hoping for even after reading the description, checking the size chart, and reading reviews.It's much lighter weight than I thought, but will surely keep me warm.I was hoping for a stiffer denim but this pas been pre-washed and feels more like a shirt material than a more rigid denim.I purchased a Large and the chest is baggier than shown in the size chart and the sleeves are shorter than I hoped. The sleeves will surely shrink to too short if I ever put it in the dryer.I'm debating whether to return it.

    The jacket is great, but Amazon really let us down this time.  First, the jacket: it fit well (xl for someone who normally wears that size) and is much closer in weight and styling to the very old favorite one being replaced than we expected.  Like the old one, it has sizing buttons on the waist, one good open interior chest pocket, and good side pockets.  The outer chest pockets are much smaller in both width and height (just barely wide enough for a smart phone but not tall enough to close over one) and have sturdy snaps instead of buttons - we'll see how these hold up.  The sleeves have one snap instead of a button.  I would give 5 stars if the chest pockets weren't so small.Now for Amazon:  we ordered this jacket prime for a particular need and it took SIX calendar days to get here.  What?  Normally our items (and we order a lot) come UPS and arrive like clockwork.  Happy customer.  This one came FedEx and the tracking notes are very interesting, starting with ""Processed by shipper and loaded in trailer said to contain package"".  Then the regular status continues showing it took 6 days, including going from California to Portland and then back to us in Southern Oregon.  We don't know if the fault was Amazon's or FedEx's, but either way, what is the remedy for this failure of service for our prime membership?  Either way, Amazon, please go back to using UPS!!

    I got this for my father who has 2 of these type of jackets in older versions. He needed this jacket in a LONGER length to cover his backside in the cold because these sherpa jean jackets are always so short, usually to the waist, which he has now, but he froze a bit in the bitter cold! This jacket has some length. He would have liked the sherpa lining to be a bit thicker but it is ok. This product seems to run bigger, which is fine because you need room in the arms to wear sweaters underneath the jacket, but I had no real idea how to gauge the size properly and returned it twice until I got him the right fit. His old ones were XL but he took a MEDIUM in this version. It has fashionable brown courdoroy trims behind the collar and on the inner cuffs ( so you can flip up the cuffs) and the cuffs have snaps, which is good. The bottom of the jacket has adjustable tab buttons on each side to make the hem have a tighter fit if you want..The jacket has metal jean buttons -- I hope the binding on the buttonholes holds up. The jean finish is softer and jacket has alot of great stitching detail. The color is a good darker to mid- blue. Maybe I will get one myself!

    Quality out the ying yang.  Arrived in pristine condition and packaged at the factory.  Had NOT been triedon and played around with ( other words sent back by somebody ).  This was a plus.  This jacket is made justlike the Wrangler jeans,  tough and durable.  The stitching is perfect,  craftsmanship immaculate .This jacket is heavy duty and very warm when the temp is in the 20's.  I cannot find any fault with this nicejacket.  If I could,  I would tell you.  If you like Wrangler jeans,  you'll like this.  The fit,  perfect.  Order thesize that you use.  This jacket is exactly as described and more.  I'm telling you,  this jacket is none lessthan 100% quality.  The buttons are metal and are put on tight.  Again,  nothing wrong with this jacket.Worth the asking price.  The lining inside the jacket is put in right,  no sagging,  sleeves and all.  It will fitwith comfort over a thick flannel winter shirt,  also machine washable just like the jeans,  with noshrinkage...

    Great jacket for dry Northern California winter days.  Size medium cut is roomy enough to wear a fleece or light sweater under the sherpa if you want, but not too baggy if you don't.  Looks good unbuttoned or buttoned up.

    The quality of this jacket is great and the delivery quick. However, it was listed as ""medium"" and the associated size given in inches matches a medium size but when delivered it was much larger than expected. I have seen this before and it is obvious that American sizes do not match the rest of the world when it comes to sizes. Fortunately, this jacket will be worn over jumpers so it can work but still a little disappointed.

    I like the more uniformly shaded, deep blue denim on this version. It isn't as thick/heavy as the Levi's sherpa jean jackets but has a much more distinctive western look. The fit is old school, somewhat boxy and not form fitting in the least. Be careful - the version on the Wrangler website is similar in color but a more ""modern"" cut. It uses much less material and is tighter - I sent that one back and got this more traditional cut jacket. Very happy with it - only complaint is I wish it had snaps instead of buttons. Makes it take a lot more time to get on and off. Buy your normal jacket size.

    Overall nice jacket. The denim is a lighter weight. Not like the denim they made into these jackets 30 years ago. Good for casual wear. Would not recommend for heavy outdoor work for.the concern of ripping the denim. Jacket is warm. I'm very happy with it for a casual jacket.

    I decided that I wanted the Levi Trucker Sherpa jacket until I tried it on.  I am 6’3 and 215 and always wear an XL. The Levi jacket in XL was too short in length and the sleeves were too short and too tight.  The XXL was too big in the body and still short in length. I found the Wrangler jacket on Amazon and after reading reviews, ordered it in XL. I’m very pleased. The jacket fits great and looks great, too. I was a bit concerned that the color would be too dark and am pleased that the “pre-wash” look is just right. And the price was about 40% less than the Levi jacket. I highly recommend it!

    The pockets on this jacket are extremely small. My adult son has had two other Wrangler jackets like this and they were fine. These pockets were too small to even fit his hands. There were no threads to cut like on new suit pockets, so clearly this jacket was faulty. We sent it back! Think twice before ordering one from this seller!

    the Tommy Hilfiger men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket and I am extremely impressed with its performance. The lightweight design makes it easy to wear, while still offering excellent protection against wind and rain. I was pleased to find that the jacket fits true to size and was comfortable to wear throughout the day.The adjustable hood is a great feature, although I do wish it was a bit larger to offer more protection during heavy storms. However, the zipper goes up high enough to keep my neck and chest dry even in harsh weather conditions.I appreciated the minimal branding on the jacket, as it allowed me to wear it with a variety of outfits. The blue color was true to the picture, and I received several compliments on the stylish design.One thing to note is that the jacket does make some noise due to the waterproof material. However, I found this to be a minor issue considering how well it performed in keeping me dry.Overall, I highly recommend the Tommy Hilfiger men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket to anyone in need of a reliable rain jacket. It offers excellent protection and style, with only minor drawbacks that do not detract from its overall quality.

    This rain jacket / windbreaker is great. It's lightweight, yet blocks just about all the wind and water. Fits perfectly, and matches the measurements listed. The hood could stand to be a little bit larger to help against really bad storms, and I wish it was detachable too. The zipper goes up high enough for dealing with bad storms. I like how minimal the brand logo is. The jacket is really stylish, only hampered by the amount of noise it makes. It's to be expected with a waterproof jacket, but it's still annoying.

    This jacket is a bargain. The fit was pretty good (not perfect), but at it's most important job which was keeping me dry on a rainy day - it worked great!I was travelling and planned to do a lot of stuff outdoors. I wanted something in case we had a rainy day and sure enough...one day had a persistent steady rain. Although we decided to end the day early, I wore the jacket close to two hours in the rain and the darn thing kept me completely dry. Not a worry at all.The hoodie kept my head dry and the rain just fell right off the jacket like nobody's business. This was without an umbrella in a light to medium steady rain. I do think in a downpour, it might struggle to keep a person dry...but come on. Let's not have unrealistic expectations. I don't think much of anything will keep a person dry in a deluge.I can't think of a negative...unless you expect it to keep you warm. This is a rain jacket. If it's cool/cold, you need to wear thermals or something warm underneath. All in all, to get a name brand jacket that looks good, is comfy, and keeps you dry at this price is a bargain!Great job TH!

    I'm 6ft ~185lbs and wanted a slim fit so I went with a size medium. I love the look but it's a tad bit restrictive when raising my arms. I'm about 15lbs over my normal weight so I'll keep this medium. I haven't tried it out in the rain yet but it would probably be sufficient for a medium drizzle.  It does nothing for keeping you warm. I probably won't wear below 45-50 degrees.

    Cette fois, j'ai commandé la bonne taille, soit L, alors que je m'habille habituellement en XL. Il faut donc suivre les recommandations concernant les hauts de la marque Carhartt, qui taillent grand, et, en général, choisir une taille en dessous de sa taille.Ceci dit, ce blouson est d'une qualité exceptionnelle (ce qui est un critère récurrent de cette marque), tant sur les matières (extérieur et intérieur), les finitions (coutures), l'alliance parfaite de la légèreté et de la protection contre le froid, les détails pratiques (poches, réglage des bas de manche), la coupe et le style.Ca mérite bien 5 étoiles

    Moin,habe diese Jacke während der ,,Black''-Angebote gekauft, da man als Student doch öfter mal aufs Geld gucken muss.Daher hab ich die Jacke für den halben Preis erstanden.Die Jacke ist sehr sehr leicht, trägt man sie, hat man vom Gewicht kaum das Gefühl etwas übergezogen zu haben.Dabei hält sie sehr warm, bei leichten Minusgraden hatte ich keine Beschwerden. Zudem ist die Verarbeitung sehr gut. Allerdings soll die Jacke recht groß ausfallen. Normalerweise trage ich XL hab aber auf Grund einger Rezensionen L bestellt. Diese passt allerdings perfekt.

    I'm 5'11"" 220 lbs 46"" chest, the large fits like it was tailored for me. The quality is very good especially the stitching and I am very happy with the jacket. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the hand pockets don't have zippers, so they're not suited for carrying small items you don't want to lose (e.g. keys, money or phone) however the chest pocket does zip so it's secure. This is the third item from  Carhartt I have. I recommend this jacket for anyone who wants a solid product made for a working man.

    I searched for a long time for a winter coat (like the puffers that are popular today) that had an outside chest pocket for a phone. I was excited by the Carhartt find, because I love the brand. Unfortunately, though, the reality of this one was that it wasn't quite warm enough for my needs. Very nice, lightweight, but is basically like a very warm windbreaker. I returned it with regrets.

    This is exactly what I wanted in a jacket.  Light weight, rain resistant.  Wind proof.It contains body heat well and generates it's own heat.  For me, it replaced a much heavier jacket that was dated.Only criticism is that it is not a true black, as shown in the photos.  It has a dark blue/grey hue to it.

    I'm a large medium. This fit perfect. The nylon seems a little thicker than most of these stuffed jackets. It's triple stitched in most places.The blue is a shade or two darker than the photo. I was pleased with it though. The chest pocket is so deep I can practically scratch my back. It has the ""inside out"" zipper I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Ive worn this is the 20-30s and its been excellent with a long sleeve t underneath. For me, it's too hot in the 40's, but that's hoodie weather for me.

    Prepare to re-sew the buttons on almost immediately.  That is the ONLY downside.This jacket it toasty warm, sized larger than usual, and chicks dig the color.  Best lightweight jacket I have had in a long, long time.  LOVE the quilted poly lining.  It can get HOT!  Beware.  Love the stringed hood.  Love the flip-up collar.  Love the double seal capability of liner zipper+ shirt buttons.  All of this makes for a fairly wide range of comfortable temperatures.

    This was a Christmas gift from my wife.  Oh, I dig this bad boy.  I'm 6'5"" with 37"" sleeves.  in XLT, I love everything about this hoodie.  It looks freakin' awesome and fits even better (and is warm).  I'm usually that guy who can't  find or afford what will fit right.  As a result, I usually end up with an XL or XXL that still has short sleeves and too much or too little girth depending on the make.  Yes, this is pricey, but it fits perfect and is made really well.  It's always exciting when you find that ""thing"" that you know will become your new ""go-to"" item.  This hoodie is that for me.

    There's nothing I dislike about this flannel.  It's comfortable,  moves with you,  doesn't bind up in your arms.  It's pretty warm.  I say thru a high school football game and was warm,  other than my hands since I did not wear gloves.  Not really sure about the other reviews,  but the size runs accordingly.  Mine is 2xl and I'm a bigger guy,  beer belly,  250lbs.One review speaks of poor stitching.  That was resolved.  There's two lines of stitching down both the button side,  and the hole side.Only thing I might recommend is a zipper on the hand pockets.  They seem a bit shallow,  and it feels like your phone will slip out on you without you knowing when you sit down.The two chest pockets are just a bit shallow as to you can't pull the pocket flap over your phone and button it. (Samsung S20+)I wear it everywhere and get compliments on its style.One of my two favorite ""go-to's"" when heading out the door.  My second favorite is my carthartt Hoodie.

    Sometime ago I have bought from Amazon a Wrangler jacket that I liked very much. So much that i have decided to buy another one/buy it again - the problem is that the fabric and the labeling of the new jacket are different from the previous one. The quality of the second jacket is much poorer (it is true it was cheaper than the previus one).Is there an explanation for selling a product with different qualities, please? Is this normal? Amazon, please check the origin of the second jacket!

    Wranglers' size- ""XLT"" arm length is excellent.  The body length is perfect too, fitting right below the belt-line.  It's a loose enough fit jacket to wear a sweatshirt underneath if need be.

    Supposée être faite pour les grands (XL Tall) cette veste est très mal taillée .Les dimensions sont  :1 - soit excessives :. Tour de taille : 120 cm.

Longueur de manches (de couture d’épaule à l’extrémité) : 65 cm. largeur d’épaules (de couture à couture) : 55 cmDes dimensions qui conviendraient plutôt aux hommes forts, mais pas pour mes 197cm et 97kg.En prenant une taille au dessus j’aurais peut-être des manches et des épaules convenables, mais le buste serait très largement surdimensionné.La qualité du tissu laisse aussi franchement à désirer. Très souple et vraiment léger ; on dirait que la veste a déjà été portée (multiple points d'usure) . Je m’attendais à un tissu plus lourd et plus rigide.Décevant pour du Wrangler.

    A is offering discounts on some sizes, but caution is needed to avoid a mistake.  My husband makes this review:*  I am 6' 0"" tall; 215 #; chest 44""; waist 39""*  XL fits very, very well.  This is a ""waist jacket"", and I am old enough to call it an ""Ike"" or ""Eisenhower jacket""*  The fit is flattering; but there is space available for a medium sweater.*  I typically wear a size 16 1/2 neck and a 34"" sleeve--I have some welcome space at the neck and the sleeve extends about 1-1 1/2"" below my wrists--I like this a lot*  I wanted the lighter color, BUT I saved about $15 with the darker.*  Reading reviews here, I DID wash it the first time with 1/4 cup salt and 1/2 cup vinegar--I believe the suggestion was made for purposes of ""fixing"" the color.  [Warm wash and cold rinse.]*  Post-wash girth and length remained the same.*  NO SMELL, PRE-WASH or POST-WASH.*  ""Fit and finish"" was very good; no defects of any kind seen; fabric quality is sturdy.*  I find it a handsome and useful weight/size.  I live in the Central Cal. desert, so we do not see much cold, even in Winter.I expect many years of use for this garment.  At current 30% off, this is a COMPELLING bargain.[Sorry, I do not take photos.]

    This jacket is very well-made, it looks great and it fits great too.  I'm a big guy, and it is difficult to find a jacket that doesn't bind around my shoulders or have cuffs that slide up to my elbows when I raise my arms over my head.  This jacket feels great and the cuffs are where they should be when I ride my motorcycle.  I paid $38.00 and I couldn't be happier.  This jacket would be a deal at 3 times the price.

    I purchased the Antique Indigo color.  I am 6'4"", 210#, 45/46"" chest, 40"" waist and 37"" sleeve length.  Size XL Tall fits me perfectly.  In my humble opinion this Wrangler Denim jacket is the best out there for the price.  I liked it so much, I went back and ordered a second jacket in case Wrangler discontinued this style.  It's that nice of a denim jacket.  In comparison, the CINCH button denim jacket sells for about $100 plus tax and shipping.  This jacket is half that price.  I have both the CINCH denim jacket and the Wrangler Denim Jacket.  The Wrangler jacket is much better quality and fit than the CINCH version.  I read most all of the reviews and have to say the Wrangler jacket I received was virtually flawless.  The stitching, metal buttons, button holes, fit, fabric and workmanship was perfect.  I would not have purchased two if I did not like this jacket.  I hope the one you receive is just as good as the two I received.

    This jacket exceed my expectations. The fit was spot on (6'2"", 275 lbs. Bought the 2x jacket.) Denim is heavier than jeans material. It's quite stiff upon arrival, but is starting to loosen up after a few weeks of wear. Color looks good and consistent. Pockets are all pretty small. The lowers are just big enough to put my hands into. Interior should be big enough to carry gloves, a smart phone/tablet, or a slim concealed carry piece. Hopefully it will last as long as the jacket that this one replaced.

The top was a gift for my son's birthday and he says it fits perfectly. He is very happy with his gift:) I would definitely buy from this seller again!!!!

    I bought the black and grey in size 2XT. It is a perfect fit. It is the second one we have purchased. First one was a different color and also a perfect fit. Fits 6'4"" husband with long arms very nicely. It is roomy enough to be comfortable, but not too big. Sleeves fit perfectly even when arms are extended, and that is hard for us to find in shirts or coats/jackets. It is super soft and warm and looks great. The fleece doesn't get yucky looking after being washed several times - it stays nice and soft. We will continue to buy this style and size in other colors as well.

    I purchased this Columbia fleece to replace one I had previously (that one's zipper finally gave out).  I was hoping for an exact match and although it wasn't exactly the same material it's pretty close and I'm very satisfied. Good quality in my opinion. Keeps me warm anyway.  The previous fleece's Columbia logo was embossed directly into the material whereas this one has a sewn on label instead.  Probably eliminated some problems but I did like it the other way better. No biggie though. Same quality, same fit. Nice product for the price.

    For some reason Columbia made the cuffs really loose on the new version of the Steens Mountain fleece, and they slip down over my hands. It's just awkward, so I returned the jacket. I guess they were trying to copy North Face, which means they are no longer a good alternative for me. I'm hoping this trend towards sleeve cuffs without anything to keep them in the correct place will disappear. It only works well for people with long arms.

    Bought for my father for Christmas. Cut is identical to my own, just a larger size. I bought him a 5XL so it's comfy.The fleece is super soft, and cuts the cold wind nicely. It's perfect in colder dry weather with a layer or two underneath. Plenty of room throughout the shoulders and stomach. Obviously it's not waterproof, but it'll definitely keep you warm if used as a layer.

    Have worn this jacket on 4 or 5 occasions when the rain could be described as torrential, it has remained totally waterproof, it has a good selection of pockets and the sleeves have inner and outer Velcro cuff closures, there are a number of D rings to use , the hood is attached with a zip and works well when in use but feels odd when down. Now  to sizing which is the strangest I have come across , I am a 40 inch chest which in the UK and Europe is medium, I ordered a medium and disappeared inside this jacket, I then ordered a small which is still very baggy on me, when I looked at the size chart the USA small is a 46 inch chest and medium is a 48 inch chest,mystery solved! Be aware of this issue and order accordingly, to summarise its a great waterproof jacket and highly recommended

    Just used the Frogg Togg's mens jacket with their bib on a week long sail excursion(s) on the Kenai Fjords out of Seward, Alaska where it was cloudy, windy, cold and rainy the entire time.  Very light weight, and easy to slip on and off.  Material is very durable and kept me dry.  The pockets were well placed and came in handy to keep items like glasses, sunscreen, and my ""Relief Band"" motion bracelet safely stowed.  I even put my wallet in one of the pockets, which was also kept dry.  When not in use the the rain gear stows away where is doesn't take up much space (think military poncho liner).  The hood of the jacket was the weakest link of the jacket.  The hood attached to the jacket with a zipper.  The hood would easily unzip itself (detaching from the jacket), and it is kind of a hassle to zip it back up while on a rolling sailboat while wearing a PFD.  And, I found it difficult to zip it back while wearing gloves.  When using the hood, I did not like how it restricted my field of vision, but you get used to that.  Better to keep warm/dry with a limited field of vision than be wet, cold, and miserable.  It does keep your head dry with enough room to wear a knit cap.  The jacket fit was loose enough to wear layers of warm clothing underneath as this rain suit will not keep you warm, but will shield you from the cold winds.  The jacket did not impede movement or flexibility for the operation of a pitching and rolling sailboat.  Highly recommended.

    Jacket showed up and was as described. However, the jacket reeked. At first we thought weed/marijuana from shipping. So we washed it (thus tag removal) only to find out it was worse. Probably skunk.We have washed the jacket, soaked it and have been airing it out for 3 weeks.So jacket would be great IF I could wear it.

    This is a great jacket for wet weather fishing. It's comfortable and fits well. I ordered the 2XL and it fits well with layers underneath. Only things I would change on the Pilot 2 would be:1: a hood that has a better locking zipper.2: Neoprene inner cuffs with elastic rather than straps. The straps are awkward to get at once the jacket is on.

    I heavily researched rain gear before deciding to pull the trigger on Frogg Toggs Pilot.  I purchased the jacket and bibs.  This is rain gear that has a waterproof rating superior to suits costing hundreds of dollars more.  It's not meant to keep you warm like a coat (if you need warmth, buy the liner for the jacket) but it will keep you dry and keep the wind off you.  My only reluctance to purchasing it was the sizing chart on the Frogg Toggs web site; using their sizing chart, I could wear small bibs and a medium jacket.  I'm six feet and weigh 230 pounds.  I wear size 36 waist pants and have a 47 inch chest.  I purchased the ""Large"" bibs and the ""Extra Large"" jacket; the fit is perfect.  This rain gear is rugged, however it is not quiet. I purchased it for fishing and other outdoor activities not related to hunting.  If you want ""quiet"", spend the extra bucks and buy gortex lined soft silent fabric.  Don't confuse this rain gear with Frogg Toggs inexpensive gear that feels like ""tyvek""; this is real rain gear that will last for several years.

    This is a perfect wind/rain jacket. It's very durable and I love the highlighted zippered waterproof pockets. I gave the jacket overall 5 stars but I do have one gripe and that's the hood. The hood just kind of flaps and hangs there and after a while, it begins to unzip itself.  My biggest concern is that I might lose the hood and I'm afraid if I take it off to store it that I might miss place or lose it. I have seen other rain /wind jackets with a better design and wish that a little more effort was put into that aspect of the jacket.

    The jacket is nice overall. The option of the insulated jacket or vest is handy and makes the jacket that much more versatile. It's light enough for a summer rain jacket that is very windproof and with the additional insulation option im comfortably wearing it fishing tournaments in November here in Michigan still with just a shirt and hoodie underneath. My only complains are the hood and the sleeves. The sleeves seen short at times like reaching down into livewells. They pull up my arms and I bend down and reach. For me it's almost a bonus but not everyone is going to appreciate that. The hook has a nice zipper for removal but the hook doesn't have its own pocket to roll up in or anything, it just detaches with a quality zipper and you do what you wish after that.I found the jacket here for a great price and I'm totally happy with it for that price ($80 or so). However full price would make me a little less impressed. I do like it as much or more than the Huk tournament jacket it replaced.

    This is a great jacket, using it for mostly ATVing. Windproof and waterproof. My only comment is the sleeves are a bit short, which coming from me , is unusual. As most of the time I have to go up one size,  to fit my shoulders, but usually big everywhere else.

    I love this thing!  It fits well over a jacket, but is also adjustable to fit without a jacket.  I've had several chances to wear it already.  I teach the motorcycle course, and we've been having many rainy days.  The hand-warmer pockets are a godsend when the rain and wind chill the air.  The hood is nice as well, and covers my head even if I still have my Tilley hat on.  This jacket is definitely worth the money.  I also bought the bib pants, and they are awesome, too.  The side pouches hold my teaching materials, so I don't have to worry about where I'm going to put them, as I did with my other rain pants.  I'm 5'11"", 215 pounds, bought both in large, and they both fit very well, once you get it adjusted to your size.

    First of all, I am 6’ 210lbs and I ordered the LARGE. I also ordered the Matching  LARGE bib pants. I think the length and fitment of this jacket is great. It’s not a fitted jacket so there is some bulk in the arms and the chest for layering which for me is great. I fish year round so layering is key to warmth. This jacket allows just that.There are lots of great features to the jacket and many pockets. My only gripe is the hood will just flap around on you if it’s not velcroed. Together around the chin area. It can be zipped off but then where do I put it?I’m. A handy guy so I’ll probably modify it somehow with some Velcro or something.—— update, I used some Velcro and double sided carpet tape (very sticky) and affixed a Velcro tab on each side of the hood hear the collar to keep it from flapping everywhere when not Velcro’d around my chin. Works very well and was super easy to do.Great jacket and pants, I’m really excited to stay warm and dry this season.

    Excellent fit, build and thoughtful design.  This has waterproof pockets galore both in and outside the main coat zipper.  Seams are all taped and it was done correctly.  Removable hood.  The jacket has cuffed inner sleeves which are further cut and tapered in such a way so when you're actually using your arms, the cuffs aren't in the way and you don't have water running up both your arms.  Nice.  Imagine that a raincoat that is useful in the rain. If there is a more thoughtfully designed and tougher jacket out there, I just don't know of it or who makes it.  I'll be buying another one of these if this one ever wears out, but it looks like that may be a bit.

    These are not the Frogg Toggs you find at you local big box sporting goods. These are premium material premium craftsmanship. I would compare them to a simms or aftco set.

    Bought this on the thought it could be a multi season jacket, there is a liner that can be bought separately for it. After I got it I decided I didn't need to spend the extra money on the liner. (It should really be included at this price point.) As a rain jacket It doesn't work any better or worse then the cheaper frogged togg jackets work issued. It does its job and keeps you dry. I haven't found it to be sweaty like those pure nylon and plastic rain jackets. Zippers work nicely. Immoretty average in height and weight. It runs a tad big, but I think with the million dollar add on liner it would likely fit about perfectly, and it does fit well over a sweater. In the end I don't think it works better then the cheaper model work issues.

    I'm 5'7 and 180. I typically wear a Large shirt/Jacket. The Jacket is an almost perfect fit for me...I have room to move around, sleeves are long enough but not too long and when I reach, it doesn't ride up my arms. Pretty happy.Since I just received it in the mail, I cannot review durability nor effectiveness in rain....it's pretty lightweight, so summer use is my guess or early fall.I'll update my review next summer after I've had a chance to use it...but happy overall.I also bought the matching pants...but I bought the Large and that's a perfect fit for me as well.The hood is a bit goofy and not sure how the draw strings work, but I'll manage it.

    I really liked the jacket, purchased the co-pilot inner coat and vest to wear in different temps. I have to do snow cleanup in Michigan so this shell kept me dry and I could wear accordingly underneath to regulate body temp as I was working in cold temps. I was comfortable with pilot co-pilot jacket combo down to -5 degrees Fahrenheit -20 Celsius, with several layers underneath. Halfway through winter though, the primary zipper for the Pilot started to separate near the bottom. The teeth will not bind and its only after about 15 min the zipper is opened up to the tab and I have to tug it down past the separation and rezip... rinse and repeat. So it lasted a season. I'll have to have a local tailor put in a new zipper for me on the Pilot or shop for  another waterproof shell with better quality zippers. The co-pilot jacket had a pocket zipper that separated on me too. I wouldn't buy the Pilot again unless they use better zipper in the future.

    I bought the Pilot II jacket, overshoes, pants, gloves that go over gloves... the whole package. I'm 6'2, 310ish.. bought the 3XL jacket and 2xl pants. Perfect fit. Love this gear! I bought it to see if I could tolerate the cold... so I rode in 40-44 degree weather on my motorcycle, with just a long sleeve shirt and light sweat pants under the gear... and I was warm! The over gloves don't provide much heat, but helped a little ; but they do cover wrists. Good gear... will wear it all year round.Only drawback.. I don't like being charged to return an item! I bought the $39.99 pants.. but decided to upgrade to $90 Pilot II pant. They charged me $7.42 to basically buy more stuff from them. Not a fan of that.. I just spent around $300+ on their gear... don't get cheap on the return.Otherwise... get the gear! Good stuff.

    I’m a conductor for BNSF railway so I’m always in the elements. I’ve struggled over the years to find rain gear that can keep me dry. Before these I bought carhartt gear which was only good for a light rain. These were able to withstand a good down poor. The only problem I had was getting my layering correct. I bought the liner that’s compatible and I over-layered and ended up sweating a little. Even with that I haven’t had this good of rain gear since I splurged on gore-tex.

    Rain jackets have always provided protection from the rain at the start but the longer you stand out in the rain the material gets saturated because the waterproof layer is no longer sufficient to bead away the moisture.  This jacket is totally different, from the beginning to a few hours into the rain it still beads off the water.  I guess the saying about you get what you paid for is true, the cost on this jacket is much higher than others but it does the job.  Wish I knew about this jacket and company a long time ago.

    I've truly given up on Amazon's size selection: It said Medium would work best. Well, in this vest I look like a shapeless frump! As others have mentioned, the cut is very boxy to begin with. The M on me looks like a shortened sack dress. I do like the vest itself (though you will have to iron the collar upon receipt). I'm exchanging for a size smaller for it to be a little more form-fitting.

    So my husband was hesitant to get one of these fleece vests because it’s associated with hedge fund managers….& he’s a hedge fund manager so he didn’t want to look like an idiot trying to be part of a club, so to speak. We live in Cali though & he needed something that would keep him warm on cool days without being too hot. He also needed something where he could really move in because he helps our son practice his baseball & he’s always throwing a ball-which isn’t easy with his typical jackets. He wanted something classic looking enough that he could show up to a casual meeting & still look good. So I bought it for him for Christmas. I’m still getting thank yous from my husband. He lives in this thing, absolutely loves it. He says it’s incredibly comfortable & perfect for cool weather. It checks every box. He also likes the simplicity of the look, the rich navy color. Tommy Hilfiger always puts out well made products and this was no exception. Fantastic!! Highly recommended!

    Maybe the problem is my expectations, but having never bought cooling gear before I expected a bit more. What I received was a vest that says it has polyester and cotton in it in the materials tag on the vest. There's no mention of PVA anywhere, and I realize now that the ""activated polymer inside"" doesn't actually specify what type of plastic they talk about in this vest.So, essentially, this is a cotton T-shirt wrapped in a layer of plastic on the outside.The expectation was that it would soak in water to its core and leave the surface at most clammy. This thing is soaking wet on the outside even after you wring it dry after immersion, and the water flows down and when the top is dry-ish, the hem is dripping. So, I can only assume this isn't in any way a ""high-tech"" vest with PVA that soaks up a lot of water and slowly releases it to get the cooling effect.. It's a bog standard cotton-polyester vest that you can soak in water.I bought a Chill-its hat alongside this. That clearly states it does have PVA in the sweatband. And the sweatband in the hat is clearly different to the vest - it's cold and somewhat clammy feeling without feeling wet. That is what I expected from the vest, but this vest appears to have none of this more unusual material in it, making it lower tech and I suppose mildly better than just wearing a wet T-shirt. Disappointing. It will cool you down, I'm sure, but at the cost of also soaking through your clothing most likely Caveat Emptor.

    Dollar for dollar , this is one of the best values I’ve come across in regards for what I got for what I spent. First off , The different colors are priced differently. I was able to immediately shave ten bucks off the price by choosing the cheapest color. It makes no difference at all since it’ll never be seen under my riding gear. I paid just a bit over $20 when the other colors were in upwards of $30. The vest arrived in the middle of brutal heatwave , with temps in the high nineties. I soaked the vest in ice water while I put on my other gear and prepped the bike. Once I put the vest on , the comfort was immediate. I rode about 100 miles in temps that never dipped below 96 and at no point in the ride did I ever feel uncomfortably hot. I was cool and comfortable the whole time. No cutting edge tech here. Just a simple accessory that took one of the biggest negatives out of my summer rides. I’ve seen evaporative cooling vests from name brands for $100 or more. Idk , maybe they have some fancy bells and whistles that make them better than this one but I can’t justify spending more when this vest does exactly what I want it to do. Dry it in the sun when you’re done to prevent bad smell/mold. My hot summer rides are now just as comfortable as my autumn rides , and for only twenty something dollars.

    I give it 5 stars although for me, I have to do some extra steps.  It works best if I don't wear a shirt underneath and if I refrigerate the vest after it's been soaked in water.  Putting it on is kind of shock but it really keeps my temperature down.  It kind of works if you just soak and/or wear a shirt underneath.Once you get it on, it doesn't drip.I haven't tried freezing it solid - just refrigerating or stashing in the freezer for 15 minutes.  If you don't refrigerate, remember that it uses evaporative cooling and works best if the humidity is not high.  I haven't tried it in anything above 60% humidity but the higher the humidity, the less effective it is.  In that case, I'd buy two and keep one in a cooler with ice and just keep swapping.  I think that is cheaper than some of the more expensive vests which have cool packs built in.

    I bought 3 of these recently. One for my husband, myself and his friend. We live in North Carolina where the summers are unbearably humid and hot. The guys go golfing and can deal but I simply cannot!My husband and I tested it out on a bike ride for about an hour and it kept us CONSIDERABLY cooler! We did soak our vests in ice water (separately) for about 5 minutes, lightly wrung them out and patted them “dry” with a towel. As other reviewers mentioned water does drip on your pants quite a lot and soaks your shirt (we wore “dri-fits”). With the humidity , we would have had sweated and been much hotter so it’s a fair trade off , especially with the price point.My husband did test hitting a few golf balls as well and said it was not cumbersome and plans to wear it golfing, to mow our grass etc.Lastly, the lime green is definitely neon yellow but when you feel the coldness against your skin, who cares?Definitely Recommend!

    This is very effective.  I soaked it for a minute or two and wrung it out.  Went for a ride in my golf cart in 112 degrees.  Felt good.  Let the vest hang outside in the shade for a couple hours.  Put it back on and rode in the cart for another hour at 110 degrees.  It kept me cool the entire time.  Beware that these really are large!  I take a 2XL and sometimes 3XL for shirts.  I am 6' tall and come in at 260#s.  My chest is 48"" (and my belly is almost the same).  The 2XL is a bit big for me but I will keep it because it does work well.  Tonight, I ordered another 1XL vest which should be just about perfect

    Got for my husband for Fathers Day. He LOVES it especially in this Texas heat. It does exactly what it says it will.  Keeps his upper body cool for hours at a time. He uses it mainly when he rides his motorcycle being that it just gets too hot to ride in the afternoons down here. He would stuff his jacket pockets with ice packets before he got this but they would melt before his commute home, now he stays nice and cool the whole ride home. He has also been know to use it when mowing the lawn also, and I’m sure will come up with many more uses. He keeps it stored mainly in a jumbo ziploc baggie filled with water so its ready to go at all times. Awesome and truly lifesaving product. Thank you!! 👏🏻👏🏻

    I work at amazon in a warehouse.  It's been really hot lately, so i thought I'd order this just for myself.  I don't do well it high heat and even simple things like walking, i'd break out in an extreme sweat.The vest does work well (but expect drips if you fully soak it for maximum cooling) and dripped on clothing.  It doesn't leak on the inside as that's waterproof, but the water does tend to 'pool' at the bottom of the vest and then drip if really soaked.  I can't have those drips so have to just soak the top half for safety reasons.  It does provide the cooling needed and especially on my bare arms that rub against the vest.  It does cool well.  To maximize the cooling effect, recharge it every 2.5 hours at minimum if you are using cold tap water like i do. (i want to freeze this or use ultra cold water).  If you don't, it gets a very humid feeling, at least for me in a warehouse where temps average 90degrees plus right now.the more you soak it, the better it is.  The colder the water is, the better it is.It does feel heavy.. but only at first.  You get used to it quickly and appreciate the lower temp feeling.  It has made quite a difference in my quality of life chart working in a warehouse.  I wish we used these for all employees.I am happy with my purchase and do recommend it to others with a few cautions as explained above.Tho it does feel a bit like wearing a wet t-shirt at times.4/5 stars.

    This thing is a life saver. I was dying on a motorcycle ride out to Ottawa last summer with temperatures between 30-35C. I put this on and my temperature instantly dropped. Thing is you really must have it exposed to the wind. If you wear it under a jacket, the upper chest part will dry out leaving the bottom permanently moist. The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is it leaks and the water eventually finds its way to the bottom of the vest where its not cooling much anymore.I bought a medium and it's slightly baggy on me: you want it as tight as comfortable for it to work best. I'm 5'9"" around 170lbs.I'm glad this is a part of my permanent motorcycle gear selection.

    I do think they lose their cooling effectiveness as the summer goes on. I notice the vest is considerably lighter, so the little cooling granules are used up or possibly squeezed out by then. I get it as wet as possible and just try to barely squeeze out the excess water so that I don't leave a water trail from the sink to my work site (which is actually my car---I also don't really want my seat soaking wet...just me!). I am a mail carrier so my air conditioner doesn't help much in the summer when we work with the window open. These vests are far superior to the ice vests I was using as I can just carry a bottle of water and refresh it quickly. I carry a 6packsize cooler full of water and just dunk it in there every few hours and keep on moving!

    this works!  A bit of trial and error for me (the first few times I did not blot enuf = my clothes got wet, but since I was in my backyard in 100 degree heat, I didnt' care.  For out in public at friend's houses for example, I had to learn how to better blot.  It definitely doesn't get me cold, but it does help keep me cool for about 3 hours in 90+ degree weather.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars (and perhaps I'm just not realistic), I would be ecstatic if this actually got colder than it does.

O and I recommended this to my Dad who preaches as a deacon in a church that while big, doesn't get very cool up in the alter area and he is thrilled too - he wears it over his shirt, but under his vestments (he got the beige color) and says it really helps him.  BTW - the customer service for Ergodyne (a local company for me) is wonderful - I had a question about sizing and the gal I called in customer service was gracious and extremely helpful!  Her advice helped me to choose the right size the 1st time around :)

    Being *EXTREMELY* sensitive to heat, and working outside these days to rebuild the backyard deck, I had rivers of sweat pouring down my eyes, blinding me in minutes. Today, in another 35C heat day, with this vest, I was as cool as a 'The Dude' Leboswki.On the down side, your clothes will be wet.On the plus side, you will survive the heat !

    Excellent Product. I'm pretty sure this is the same manufacturer that makes cooling vests for Sedici (motorcycle brand) ORDER DOWN A SIZE! I'm 5'9 L and an XL with ""slim fit"" shirts. I trusted the reviews and ordered down a size.. the medium fit PERFECTLY.It's incredible what a difference this jacket made for me. For my motorcycle people: YOU NEED THIS! It fit perfectly in my suit and did not restrict movement or make me feel uncomfortable. Jacket lasts about 40 minutes before you need to toss it back into your ice chest (which is PERFECT!) Make sure it's soaked in water or else your body won't be able to transfer heat to the jacket as efficiently.I was hydrating as frequently as I would with a normal trackday and I could barely break a sweat in 90 degree weather. I didn't wear the jacket for one of the sessions...Suddenly I was extremely uncomfortable I had sweat running down my eyes.stop doubting and buy!

    Yes, there are probably better options out on the market but, for the price, this vest works as described. I think they are a little larger than posted…l see where folks get them wet and put them in the fridge, before using them. We don’t have that luxury when your riding 450 miles in 100 degree dry heat for 7-8 hours a day. In this type of weather, l was stopping every 3 hours and refuel the bike and rewatering the vest… The lime yellow is very bright and noticeable, good for visibility by others. The vest keeps me alert and comfortable too… well made and affordable..

    High quality materials.  Absorbs a lot of water without being heavy or awkward.  Holds onto moisture but dries completely. Instantly cools the body like jumping into water... So I would day it will buy an hour in the Okanagan Sun where it is dry but very very hot.

    I was not impressed. Wetting the vest down with cold water didn't keep me any cooler. I even went to the extreme and placed it in my freezer. Once it was frozen, the coolnest only lasted for about 20 minutes. The vest also adds a few pounds to your burden of having to wear extra weight in the heat. I will be returning it.

    I bought this for my husband who works outside in the Texas heat. He tried it a couple of times and doesn't like it. If it's excessively hot, 100+, this really won't help. It might be effective in less hot and humid climates. Not a bad product just didn't work for him.

    I thought the vest may have a special absorbent liner between the outer and inner shell, but appears to be only 2 layers of fabric. Hence it does weep considerably after being soaked and wrung and the water travels to the lower parts. In retrospect any soaked fabric vest would have the same effect. It does fit well and comfortable and does cool by keeping your T-shirt soaked - which isn't a bad thing when you're sweating anyways.

Their quality has always been excellent.The gilet is well made but slightly less thicker than I thought it was going to be.I've worn it a few times and each time I've been kept warm, so maybe the thickness is not needed.The zips are good quality and feel like they will last.For £55 it's great value and not worth anymore.I'm a 58"" chest and it fits nice and will go over a jacket if needed or under with no hassle.Its not bulky and does not feel like I'm wrapped in a sleeping bag.Good value.

    Da ich schon eine andere Weste von Columbia besitze, welche allerdings rundum gepolstert ist und innen mit einer extra Alu-Thermoschicht ausgestattet ist, wollte ich noch eine nicht ganz so warme Weste für die etwas wärmeren der Herbst- und Frühlingstage, bei denen man zwar gerne noch Weste tragen aber gleichzeitig nicht dabei schwitzen möchte. Da nur vorne und hinten wärmendes Polster verwendet wird, ist unter den Armen für mein Empfinden angenehm dünnerer Stoff, was sich ja durch die natürliche Position der Arme gut ausgleicht. Wie erwähnt: Für richtig kalte Tage in Kombi mit Jacke oder gar als regelrechter Jackenersatz ist sie etwas dünn, aber für nicht ganz so frische Tage oder in Kombi mit Pullover morgens zum Beispiel aber prima geeignet. Bei 10 bis 15 Grad ist sie derzeit meine erste Wahl.

Der Hauptreisverschluss ist bei der Herrenweste für Damen ausgelegt, sehr ungewohnt da spiegelverkehrt zum verschliessen.2. Die beiden Reissverschlüssen für die Taschen links und rechts lassen sich sehr schwer öffnen und schließen, da sie sich stets im Textilgewebe verfangen und man den Verschluss erst wieder herauslösen muss. Das habe ich bei einer Markenweste nicht erwartet. Deswegen insgesamt nur 3 Sterne.

This one is a replacement for my original that I got as a gift many years ago.  The old one has held up well, but is starting to show it’s age.  I was very happy to see that the new one is made as well as my old one.  I expect to get many years of use from it.

    I love these. im 6'3"" 210lbs with a longer than average torso and these sit about 2-3 inches below my belt which for me is what I consider a perfect fit.  The quality of the stitching is on point and the zippers work very well.

    Pedí primero una L y me quedo algo grande, la logré vender y después encontré una Mediana y me quedo perfecta! Estoy entre ambas tallas dependiendo la marca y el corte, pidan la talla que son normalmente, es muy suave y se siente de buena calidad, pensé que iba a ser para heladas en una montaña pero no la sentí tan calurosa, pero como sudadera en una temperatura baja está bien, el precio bajo en la que la conseguí está perfecto!

    I’m 6’ 230 lbs and the xl tall is perfect for my use, mostly as a warm shirt, which keeps the small of my back covered. If I wanted it more as a jacket, I would want a xxl. The sleeves are a bit long but the elastic in the wrists make it perfect for sliding up and doing dishes or washing hands. The zipper works real smooth, like it has extra quality teeth. AND the wife is so happy, cause it replaced my Mr. Rogers sweaters. Go figure.

    My Son loves the Steen’s Mountain jackets. He has several. I ordered a black one for him for a gift and got a blue one. It was for a gift; I assumed it was black and gave it to him so I didn’t get to exchange it. He wanted black.

    Bought this to replace a very similar looking Berghaus Polartec Fleece which lasted a good 4 years.The material of this fleece is much softer to the touch, however although it is black, it seems slightly lighter in colour when put next to the black berghaus fleece. This fleece also fits slightly larger as a Medium however does not give off an oversized look.My favourite things about the product are the zip pockets, cuffed arms and the bottom of the fleece is elasticated so it keeps warm air in. Good price too at around £26 at the time of review - can't really ask for more at this price point.

    Amazon had a note on the product page: ""Large will fit you best based on data from customers who buy the same sizes as you"" - I wanted to believe this algorithm was correct & glad I read other reviews - I'm 5'7"" 110-115 lbs w a waist size of 29/30"" - I looked at the sizing table and sure enough Small is my size which I was suspicious of as I usually get Medium. I got lucky Medium went out of stock & gambled on the Small. while waiting, I realized my trusty old fleece I am replacing is a Columbia & a Small!  that cinched the deal & put me at peace. When it arrived today, it fits just as well - it doesnt seem as thick as my old one so I'm gonna just have to try it on my upcoming trip to cooler regions & see how it performs. I hope it lasts as long as my old one - it's easily been a daily driver for over 5 years (I wouldn't doubt if it is 10 years old to be honest!) - the cuffs are completely stretched out & just found out it will be easy to replace the broken YYK zip pull so it will be regulated to casual use as it a *very* effective middle layer with a turtleneck (or thermal) underneath & windbreaker on top!again, this review is mostly to inform about sizing to help others nail it the first time - I just put my experience with a prior Columbia product I've been more than happy with that led to this purchase.  I'll probably update this review after I've used the new one extensively in a very similar manner (esp camping 🏕️)UPDATE (5/2/23): the new one seems surprisingly warmer - I don’t know if it’s because of the sheer age of the old one - but thinner/warmer/lighter is always welcome. I also noticed they cut costs by only putting one cinch buckle around the waist (it used to be on both sides) - the quality of the buckle is smaller and clearly cheaper & the elastic that goes around is thinner.  I’m glad the waist elastic is still in the product but it sure doesn’t look like it’s going to last 10-15 years - I guess we’ll see.  you’ll also have to wash and/or air out the fleece - while it’s not overbearing - I could tell my skin felt a bit sensitive to whatever leftover chemicals that were left from the process and I only put it on for maybe 15 min while it was new?  and I can confirm that they’ve switched from the embroidered logo for a stitched tag - before it was very subtle and blended and now it’s blatant branding (which I do have mixed feelings about).  The zips are still YYK fortunately. This one is made in Bangladesh (where my old one was made in Vietnam).  okay these are just first impressions - now to put it to some rigorous field testing for a few years!UPDATE (6/8/23): just got back from a 18 day trip and this has been field tested :) it did well in 50 degree weather in the Santa Cruz mountains layered w a turtleneck (UNIQLO heat tech) and a windbreaker (I could notice a big difference without the windbreaker, in fact, I was cold in 50 degree weather. In 60 degree weather layered with a quick dry T & long sleeve shell, I was plenty warm without the windbreaker). Something that is annoying is the way they've attached the rope pulls on the zippers - they've come off 2 or 3x already - you're likely to lose them if you are not careful. Once it came off casually & yesterday I went to wash it & one was just lying inside the machine - it's only attached via a simple loop to the zip pull & clearly a ""cosmetic"" thing. I'm tempted to dock a star but from a pure functionally standpoint, the fleece did its most basic job (keep me warm!) and looks so much better than my drab grey one I had prior!  I'm still satisfied :)

    me he comprado los dos forros polares, el glacier de North Face y este de Columbia, básicamente uno compite directamente con el otro. Los dos me encantan, si bien la talla M es mucho mas ajustada para el de North face que el de Columbia que es mas holgado, aunque no es que te quede grande, simplemente hay tipos de forros polares, unos que te permiten poner mas ropa en el interior, y otros que se ajustan mas para cuando no necesitas mas ropa pero estar cómodo y calentito. Por ejemplo si hace mucho frio durante años me he puesto dos forros polares y no necesitaba chaqueta (lo que me parecía super comodo), pero siempre me ponía dos holgados, ahora podré ponerme el glacier debajo y este encima, genial. Estoy por comprar otro, los dos son de alta calidad y calientan mucho, cremalleras como me gustan en los bolsillos, y un precio absurdamente bajo en comparación al precio cuando salieron, estos forros son mucho mejores que los forros de otras marcas al mismo precio.

    Just received this jacket and first impression is very good. Medium - Fits well if a tad snug. The feel of the jacket is smooth and soft. The color, red, is not a bright red, so fits my color tastes perfectly. Zippers are very smooth up and down. I like that it zips all the way up into a high collar, keeping the neck area warm in cold/cool air. Inside pockets on both sides, nice. Stepped outside for a minute on this cool not cold day and it feels quite warm. Will see over time how warm it is in colder weather. I do have a heavier Hilfiger jacket for very cold weather so this was bought for cool to cooler weather. Obviously have not worn it in the rain, but then I do not spend a lot of time in the rain, so it is not of much concern to me. I'm sure it will do fine for running to and from the car. Noticed one commenter complained it is cheap and thin. I'd ask what do you not understand about the description that say's it is a lightweight jacket. Still it does not strike me as cheap (very reasonably priced) and of good quality. If my experience changes I'll be back to update, but for now I am very satisfied with this jacket and am thinking of getting another with the ICE color and maybe a step up in size. Though I do like a slim look as compared to big and bulky, so maybe not. ;-)

    I ordered this in mens small for my wife. She has long arms, and womens sleeves are too short. She got the pink and it's very warm. She prefers a snugger fit so small for a 38c works well, muscular build. Women that want a looser fit in waist/mid section order up.

    I purchased this jacket for my husband to wear on our Alaskan cruise late September 2023. He likes the fit, feel and lack of bulk. He also likes that the shoulder to sleeve is a bit longer than he expected as he being 6’4 and ^ 300lbs his shoulder to sleeve is rather longer than is custom, this fit him perfectly and can squish down to a packable daypack size.  My advice to you - take your measurements and buy according to those measurements, it really is the most accurate sizing you’ll ever get.

    Resultó ser un poco más delgada de lo que esperaba, para brindó buena protección contra una lluvia ligera pero pertinaz, y una temperatura de 4 grados centígrados (traía, además, una sudadera ligera abajo).El diseño es sobrio y bonito, en términos generales, lo que para mi es un punto positivo pues no deseaba una prenda que llamara la atención.La talla que pedí fue la que me llegó, sin mencionar que la recibí antes de la fecha estimada de llegada.

    En general todo bien, solo que, a pesar de revisar la tabla de medidas, la talla mediana no fue la ideal para mí (mido 1.85 y peso 78 kg). En algunos comentarios de otros países había leído que venían amplios y con mangas largas, pero en mi caso, el rompevientos me ajustó bien, como para traer apenas una o dos capas debajo, pero las mangas ligeramente cortas (2-3 cm).

    En las fotos se veía muy bien pero al recibirla y probarla no me resultó tan bien.Su tallaje era especialmente grande y amplio cuando era la talla que uso habitualmente en mis prendas. Se hubiera solucionado solicitando un cambio por una talla menor pero no se hizo así porque la que quedaba excesivamente grande y amplia tenía unas mangas, a mi juicio, que me resultaban demasiado cortas; de haber cambiado la chaqueta por otra de talla menor las mangas aún me resultarían más cortas. Me fastidió el resultado obtenido porque me había gustado especialmente al ver sus imágenes.En cuanto al proceso de devolución resultó rápido y totalmente satisfactorio.

    Kurz zur Info: Ich bin 1,88m (und wiege 90kg). Daher habe ich die Brandit in Größe XL bestellt.  Passt hervorragend, insbesondere auch bzgl. der Armlänge mit der ich oft Probleme habe (zu kurz). Mit der Brandit nicht.Da ich die Jacke für Foto-Wanderungen und Kamera-Outdoor nutzen wollte, sollte es eine Känguru-Jacke für Objektive etc. sein. Und tatsächlich, in diese Jacke passt mein 300er Zoom-Objektiv mit 20 cm Länge perfekt hinein. Ich bekomme sogar das dicke Tamron 150-500 mm noch rein, die Tasche ist groß genug. Der abgedeckte Reissverschluss an allen Taschen schützt zudem sehr gut gegen ""unschönes"" Wetterverhältnisse. Fazit: Sehr gutes Produkt zu einem fast sagenhaft guten Preis.

    Es una prenda cómoda y bonita para el día a día aunque las mangas podrían tener un mejor diseño. Holgada, si te gusta la ropa más ajustada quizá deberías escoger una talla menos. Perfecta como cortavientos. Pero... no sirve en absoluto para la lluvia. Un par de minutos del coche a casa con lluvia y el agua entró, tal vez por las costuras. Gran decepción, no me sirve, mi idea era echarla a la mochila para el monte.

    Ich war angenehm überrascht, die Jacke ist sehr leicht und trotzdem gut wasserdicht. Auch durch die Unterfütterung entsteht ein kleines Luftpolster, was für eine angenehme Trageeigenschafft sorgt, auch dann noch wenn man im starken Regen unterwegs ist. Die Klettverschlüsse mit dem Reißverschluss schützen vor Wind und Wasser, an den Armen sind Gummibündchen und auch die Kapuze kann man durch Zugbändchen am Gesicht gut anlegen. Über Farben lässt sich auch streiten, ich bevorzuge etwa Neutrales, aber auch für Jugendliche ist eine sehr gute Auswahl vorhanden. Ich finde die Jacke als sehr empfehlenswert.

Die Belüftungssysteme funktionieren hervorragend, um ein angenehmes Körperklima zu gewährleisten.Die Langlebigkeit dieser Herren Regenjacke hat mich ebenfalls überzeugt. Trotz mehrfacher Benutzung und verschiedener Wetterbedingungen zeigt sie keinerlei Abnutzungserscheinungen. Die Qualität der Verarbeitung ist wirklich bemerkenswert.In Bezug auf das Design bin ich äußerst zufrieden.

    Zuerst die guten Nachrichten: Lieferung war in Ordnung und die Größe der Jacke passte sehr gut. Was bei meinem Bauch nicht so einfach ist. Die Jacke wird als Windbreaker und Regenjacke beworben. Windbreaker passt. Aber Regenjacke ist das keine. Gleich beim ersten Regen war ich nach etwa 5 min. bis auf mein T-Shirt durchnässt. Unter Regenjacke verstehe ich etwas anderes. Ich werde sie trotzdem behalten. In meiner Größe ist es nicht so einfach, passende Kleidung zu finden. Daher freue ich mich jetzt über eine Übergangsjacke mit einem guten Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. 2 Punkte Abzug, weil es einfach keine Regenjacke ist.

    Lets just put it out there this is more for casual wear than anything else. Sure it comes in camouflage but so do a lot of none tacticool cloths. Quality is fine but while billed as a ""Summer"" wind jacket I would only where this during the summer in the UK, Scandinavia, or Upper Siberia. If you want a true summer weight pullover go with the Helikon Wind Shirt. This has no functionality above your average kangaroo pocket pullover but it does have one mysterious zip air vent on one side of the pullover but not the other, so much to the concept of pass through ventilation. So all in all wahawahwahhhhh. Oh and this is the first pullover I've had that doesn't have a pass through onesi hand pocket. :(

    This is a nice looking hoodie and fits well.I had some issues with the bottom elastic, it came broken and had to remove. Not a massive problem but would be nice to be able to tighten on cold days.It says that it is waterproof and this I correct if you are outside for a sort period of time. Once the water has had a chance to seep in….. it’s game over. It’s like wearing a mop.Over all I like this product but wish the quality was a little better and was a little more water resistant.

    Maybe the problem is my expectations, but having never bought cooling gear before I expected a bit more. What I received was a vest that says it has polyester and cotton in it in the materials tag on the vest. There's no mention of PVA anywhere, and I realize now that the ""activated polymer inside"" doesn't actually specify what type of plastic they talk about in this vest.So, essentially, this is a cotton T-shirt wrapped in a layer of plastic on the outside.The expectation was that it would soak in water to its core and leave the surface at most clammy. This thing is soaking wet on the outside even after you wring it dry after immersion, and the water flows down and when the top is dry-ish, the hem is dripping. So, I can only assume this isn't in any way a ""high-tech"" vest with PVA that soaks up a lot of water and slowly releases it to get the cooling effect.. It's a bog standard cotton-polyester vest that you can soak in water.I bought a Chill-its hat alongside this. That clearly states it does have PVA in the sweatband. And the sweatband in the hat is clearly different to the vest - it's cold and somewhat clammy feeling without feeling wet. That is what I expected from the vest, but this vest appears to have none of this more unusual material in it, making it lower tech and I suppose mildly better than just wearing a wet T-shirt. Disappointing. It will cool you down, I'm sure, but at the cost of also soaking through your clothing most likely Caveat Emptor.

    Dollar for dollar , this is one of the best values I’ve come across in regards for what I got for what I spent. First off , The different colors are priced differently. I was able to immediately shave ten bucks off the price by choosing the cheapest color. It makes no difference at all since it’ll never be seen under my riding gear. I paid just a bit over $20 when the other colors were in upwards of $30. The vest arrived in the middle of brutal heatwave , with temps in the high nineties. I soaked the vest in ice water while I put on my other gear and prepped the bike. Once I put the vest on , the comfort was immediate. I rode about 100 miles in temps that never dipped below 96 and at no point in the ride did I ever feel uncomfortably hot. I was cool and comfortable the whole time. No cutting edge tech here. Just a simple accessory that took one of the biggest negatives out of my summer rides. I’ve seen evaporative cooling vests from name brands for $100 or more. Idk , maybe they have some fancy bells and whistles that make them better than this one but I can’t justify spending more when this vest does exactly what I want it to do. Dry it in the sun when you’re done to prevent bad smell/mold. My hot summer rides are now just as comfortable as my autumn rides , and for only twenty something dollars.

    I give it 5 stars although for me, I have to do some extra steps.  It works best if I don't wear a shirt underneath and if I refrigerate the vest after it's been soaked in water.  Putting it on is kind of shock but it really keeps my temperature down.  It kind of works if you just soak and/or wear a shirt underneath.Once you get it on, it doesn't drip.I haven't tried freezing it solid - just refrigerating or stashing in the freezer for 15 minutes.  If you don't refrigerate, remember that it uses evaporative cooling and works best if the humidity is not high.  I haven't tried it in anything above 60% humidity but the higher the humidity, the less effective it is.  In that case, I'd buy two and keep one in a cooler with ice and just keep swapping.  I think that is cheaper than some of the more expensive vests which have cool packs built in.

    I bought 3 of these recently. One for my husband, myself and his friend. We live in North Carolina where the summers are unbearably humid and hot. The guys go golfing and can deal but I simply cannot!My husband and I tested it out on a bike ride for about an hour and it kept us CONSIDERABLY cooler! We did soak our vests in ice water (separately) for about 5 minutes, lightly wrung them out and patted them “dry” with a towel. As other reviewers mentioned water does drip on your pants quite a lot and soaks your shirt (we wore “dri-fits”). With the humidity , we would have had sweated and been much hotter so it’s a fair trade off , especially with the price point.My husband did test hitting a few golf balls as well and said it was not cumbersome and plans to wear it golfing, to mow our grass etc.Lastly, the lime green is definitely neon yellow but when you feel the coldness against your skin, who cares?Definitely Recommend!

    This is very effective.  I soaked it for a minute or two and wrung it out.  Went for a ride in my golf cart in 112 degrees.  Felt good.  Let the vest hang outside in the shade for a couple hours.  Put it back on and rode in the cart for another hour at 110 degrees.  It kept me cool the entire time.  Beware that these really are large!  I take a 2XL and sometimes 3XL for shirts.  I am 6' tall and come in at 260#s.  My chest is 48"" (and my belly is almost the same).  The 2XL is a bit big for me but I will keep it because it does work well.  Tonight, I ordered another 1XL vest which should be just about perfect

    Got for my husband for Fathers Day. He LOVES it especially in this Texas heat. It does exactly what it says it will.  Keeps his upper body cool for hours at a time. He uses it mainly when he rides his motorcycle being that it just gets too hot to ride in the afternoons down here. He would stuff his jacket pockets with ice packets before he got this but they would melt before his commute home, now he stays nice and cool the whole ride home. He has also been know to use it when mowing the lawn also, and I’m sure will come up with many more uses. He keeps it stored mainly in a jumbo ziploc baggie filled with water so its ready to go at all times. Awesome and truly lifesaving product. Thank you!! 👏🏻👏🏻

    I work at amazon in a warehouse.  It's been really hot lately, so i thought I'd order this just for myself.  I don't do well it high heat and even simple things like walking, i'd break out in an extreme sweat.The vest does work well (but expect drips if you fully soak it for maximum cooling) and dripped on clothing.  It doesn't leak on the inside as that's waterproof, but the water does tend to 'pool' at the bottom of the vest and then drip if really soaked.  I can't have those drips so have to just soak the top half for safety reasons.  It does provide the cooling needed and especially on my bare arms that rub against the vest.  It does cool well.  To maximize the cooling effect, recharge it every 2.5 hours at minimum if you are using cold tap water like i do. (i want to freeze this or use ultra cold water).  If you don't, it gets a very humid feeling, at least for me in a warehouse where temps average 90degrees plus right now.the more you soak it, the better it is.  The colder the water is, the better it is.It does feel heavy.. but only at first.  You get used to it quickly and appreciate the lower temp feeling.  It has made quite a difference in my quality of life chart working in a warehouse.  I wish we used these for all employees.I am happy with my purchase and do recommend it to others with a few cautions as explained above.Tho it does feel a bit like wearing a wet t-shirt at times.4/5 stars.

    This thing is a life saver. I was dying on a motorcycle ride out to Ottawa last summer with temperatures between 30-35C. I put this on and my temperature instantly dropped. Thing is you really must have it exposed to the wind. If you wear it under a jacket, the upper chest part will dry out leaving the bottom permanently moist. The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is it leaks and the water eventually finds its way to the bottom of the vest where its not cooling much anymore.I bought a medium and it's slightly baggy on me: you want it as tight as comfortable for it to work best. I'm 5'9"" around 170lbs.I'm glad this is a part of my permanent motorcycle gear selection.

    I do think they lose their cooling effectiveness as the summer goes on. I notice the vest is considerably lighter, so the little cooling granules are used up or possibly squeezed out by then. I get it as wet as possible and just try to barely squeeze out the excess water so that I don't leave a water trail from the sink to my work site (which is actually my car---I also don't really want my seat soaking wet...just me!). I am a mail carrier so my air conditioner doesn't help much in the summer when we work with the window open. These vests are far superior to the ice vests I was using as I can just carry a bottle of water and refresh it quickly. I carry a 6packsize cooler full of water and just dunk it in there every few hours and keep on moving!

    this works!  A bit of trial and error for me (the first few times I did not blot enuf = my clothes got wet, but since I was in my backyard in 100 degree heat, I didnt' care.  For out in public at friend's houses for example, I had to learn how to better blot.  It definitely doesn't get me cold, but it does help keep me cool for about 3 hours in 90+ degree weather.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars (and perhaps I'm just not realistic), I would be ecstatic if this actually got colder than it does.  O well, I'm happy w/ this as I'm not aware of anything else (w/in a reasonable price point) that would do a better job.  O and I recommended this to my Dad who preaches as a deacon in a church that while big, doesn't get very cool up in the alter area and he is thrilled too - he wears it over his shirt, but under his vestments (he got the beige color) and says it really helps him.  BTW - the customer service for Ergodyne (a local company for me) is wonderful - I had a question about sizing and the gal I called in customer service was gracious and extremely helpful!  Her advice helped me to choose the right size the 1st time around :)

    Excellent Product. I'm pretty sure this is the same manufacturer that makes cooling vests for Sedici (motorcycle brand) ORDER DOWN A SIZE! I'm 5'9 L and an XL with ""slim fit"" shirts. I trusted the reviews and ordered down a size.. the medium fit PERFECTLY.It's incredible what a difference this jacket made for me. For my motorcycle people: YOU NEED THIS! It fit perfectly in my suit and did not restrict movement or make me feel uncomfortable. Jacket lasts about 40 minutes before you need to toss it back into your ice chest (which is PERFECT!) Make sure it's soaked in water or else your body won't be able to transfer heat to the jacket as efficiently.I was hydrating as frequently as I would with a normal trackday and I could barely break a sweat in 90 degree weather. I didn't wear the jacket for one of the sessions...Suddenly I was extremely uncomfortable I had sweat running down my eyes.stop doubting and buy!

    Yes, there are probably better options out on the market but, for the price, this vest works as described. I think they are a little larger than posted…l see where folks get them wet and put them in the fridge, before using them. We don’t have that luxury when your riding 450 miles in 100 degree dry heat for 7-8 hours a day. In this type of weather, l was stopping every 3 hours and refuel the bike and rewatering the vest… The lime yellow is very bright and noticeable, good for visibility by others. The vest keeps me alert and comfortable too… well made and affordable..

    High quality materials.  Absorbs a lot of water without being heavy or awkward.  Holds onto moisture but dries completely. Instantly cools the body like jumping into water... So I would day it will buy an hour in the Okanagan Sun where it is dry but very very hot.

    I use this for woodworking in my garage during the summer in Tucson. This plus a bucket of ice water to recharge and a fan works pretty good to stay cool. Three stars because it seems to leak some of the gel every time I soak it.

    I was not impressed. Wetting the vest down with cold water didn't keep me any cooler. I even went to the extreme and placed it in my freezer. Once it was frozen, the coolnest only lasted for about 20 minutes. The vest also adds a few pounds to your burden of having to wear extra weight in the heat. I will be returning it.

    I bought this for my husband who works outside in the Texas heat. He tried it a couple of times and doesn't like it. If it's excessively hot, 100+, this really won't help. It might be effective in less hot and humid climates. Not a bad product just didn't work for him.

    I thought the vest may have a special absorbent liner between the outer and inner shell, but appears to be only 2 layers of fabric. Hence it does weep considerably after being soaked and wrung and the water travels to the lower parts. In retrospect any soaked fabric vest would have the same effect. It does fit well and comfortable and does cool by keeping your T-shirt soaked - which isn't a bad thing when you're sweating anyways.

    Hubby needed a new jacket.  He didn't have a decent spring/fall option in the closet.I ordered this London Fog jacket because I'm a huge fan of the brand.  I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered a large tall because he's 6'4"", with a 36 in sleeve.  Finding clothes that fit him can be difficult, so I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.It was a hit!  The jacket, and sleeves, fit beautifully.  It has enough room to wear a sweater under it, without feeling tight, but doesn't look baggy over a lightweight shirt.  The price was excellent, so that was a bonus.London Fog has always had a reputation for quality, and its never disappointed me.  I expect him to get several years of use out of this particular purchase.

    It got real cold in November and I realized my big size parka jacket was falling apart and my windbreaker was too small, especially when I’m carrying my licensed CCW.Ordered this in 4XL and a big, fluffy parka in 5XL ( a hunch and I was right, it was junk and didn’t fit at 5xl and back to China it goes )Showed up in 2 or 3 days and is nice quality, very roomy, even carrying my Glock,,, the parka finally showed up, 8 weeks later— and winter is almost over! Damn Amazon need to tell the truth about when a product is being mailed from China  and will take months to arrive THAT IS NOT FOR THIS ITEM- it showed up in 2 or 3 days!It is a bit weird in that the lining is loosely attached,, almost like it’s removable. I need to look into it a bit.

    Needed something other than a hoodie.  It doesn't often get cold enough that a hoodie doesn't do it, but my weather resistant nylon shell jacket that I'd had for 20+ years finally needed to go.This is a good one.  Sheds rain well enough that I don't get soaked between the truck and wherever I'm going into, it fits right, and it has a ton of pockets.Not crazy that it has 2 side pockets on each side, one with a zipper and one without but I just zipped up the zipper pockets and now I don't have to check both pockets when I stick my phone or keys in a side pocket.I'd buy it again and I'm pretty picky.  I have huge shoulders and the sleeves on this one are actually long enough without being stupid long.I'm a little over 6 ft tall, about 270 and most of my height is in my torso.

    Whatever the material the jacket is made of, it doesn't breath. That's fine if its autumn or winter, but is less than ideal for the spring or early summer. Other golf jackets I've had in the past were made of more breathable material. I wear a jacket most of the time, but I also live in an area with warm weather most of the year, so I need a light, breathable jacket. This is one purchase I sincerely regret.

    I found this a good size for me. I'm 5' 5"" and the 'small' was not ridiculously long, though I think it would still fit someone quite a lot taller. It's a forgiving, sort of squarish cut rather than an athletic fit. More suitable for the office, or wearing under an overcoat, than using for hiking/camping. Good quality zips and quite warm.

The M on me looks like a shortened sack dress. I do like the vest itself (though you will have to iron the collar upon receipt). I'm exchanging for a size smaller for it to be a little more form-fitting.

    So my husband was hesitant to get one of these fleece vests because it’s associated with hedge fund managers….& he’s a hedge fund manager so he didn’t want to look like an idiot trying to be part of a club, so to speak. We live in Cali though & he needed something that would keep him warm on cool days without being too hot. He also needed something where he could really move in because he helps our son practice his baseball & he’s always throwing a ball-which isn’t easy with his typical jackets. He wanted something classic looking enough that he could show up to a casual meeting & still look good. So I bought it for him for Christmas. I’m still getting thank yous from my husband. He lives in this thing, absolutely loves it. He says it’s incredibly comfortable & perfect for cool weather. It checks every box. He also likes the simplicity of the look, the rich navy color. Tommy Hilfiger always puts out well made products and this was no exception. Fantastic!! Highly recommended!

    I bought this for a costume a few months ago and didn't want to review it until after I've worn it for the event so now I can give a more educated review.I carry all my weight around my waist and I normally use L or XL shirts (90% of my t-shirts are Aeropostale so if you fit in a regular US L size that should give you an idea), just to be safe I thought I'd get a XXXL and take it in where needed (easier to remove cloth than add more). As it turns out it fit me just right, so if you're a bigger guy this is definitely not for you. The vest part is not going to forgive any beer belly. That said, there is a reason suits were tailored this way in the past, the coat is cut in a way that it gives a slimming effect around the waist and a bulkier appearance around the shoulders for a nicer V body shape.The coat is a little heavy and thankfully not lined. Because it has a wide collar and it has no lining I could wear this and not get too hot despite being a relatively warm day. The coat felt about the same as if I was wearing a sweatshirt. A little warm but nothing unbearable in a late summer heat.The coatails are a little long and I could feel them hit the back of my boots when I took a step, but I have a long stride. If you wear this outdoors you might get mud on your coat if you're not careful (I'm 5'11 for the record) still they look fine and people said they didn't notice I was kicking them nor did they look ridiculously long as I feared.The arms were a bit long for me, when I bring my arms down the cuff came almost to my knuckles, but I can't fault them for that, it's impossible to get a perfect size on people of all shapes and sizes, just note that if you have short arms you may need to roll them a little or trim them. I intended to shorten them but in the end I went against it since I was tipping my hat for pictures and lifting my hands often holding the syringe so I rarely had my hands down for too long.I'm an amateur tailor, I know my way around sewing machines and I can vouch that the workmanship is pretty good, there were just a couple loose threads here and there but they were just leftovers from after they finished stitching and they cut the thread a little long, i just snipped the loose threads and went on my merry way, nothing was loose or at risk of unraveling, the vest ""buttons"" are actually snap fasteners and they took quite a beating from me test-wearing the outfit several times as more pieces were ready and yet I never had any issues with them.The label specifically said DarcChic so I can't confirm my review applies to other lookalike products on Amazon.

    I had my concerns about buying this product because a lot of the reviews said that the sizing was all messed up. Not the case for me I just ordered my normal jacket size and this thing fits perfect and was absolutely shocked at how high-quality the material is that this thing is made out of. At the price I paid expected cheap flimsy material but what I got was nice thick denim style of fabric .

    Like many of you reading these reviews, I struggled with determining which size to buy, since individual accounts of the fit vary WILDLY, from ""as expected"" to ""BUY AT LEAST TWO SIZES UP!"" So I thought I'd add a detailed personal account of the size Medium. Hopefully it helps someone.I'm a male. 5'9"", 170 lbs. My build is slim/athletic. Not skinny or anything, but fairly slim and I like my clothes the same way. This coat was PERFECT in Medium, which is what I typically wear in everything. The shoulder seam hit right at the corner like it's supposed to (and my shoulders are somewhat broad). When I buttoned up the faux vest - the only way this coat fastens - it was not too tight, not too loose. The tails are dramatic - they hit at the mid-calf.As for the material, as others have stated it's similar to a soft denim. Pretty comfy. As a backup I ordered one of those cheap polyester versions of this coat from one of the many generic sellers on here, in case this one didn't fit, but that's going straight back. This one is high quality enough to wear as regular clothes, if I felt like it.Oh, and I got it in the burgundy color, which was, well, burgundy. Or maroon. Purplish-red.Very happy with this. I recommend ordering your normal size in shirts if you're pondering this decision as I did.

    I love the look and fit.  The material is denim and is durable.  As coat, the material (denim) does feel a little on the cheap side for this kind of styling.  I would have expected something thicker and of better quality.  With that said, it looks great.  The fit is two sizes small in my opinion.  I wear a large, so I ordered XL, but even that was a bit snug.  I would order two sizes larger if I was to do it again, but the XL works so I'm not going to go through the hassle of returning it and getting the XXL.  I'm 5'7"" tall and weight 180 pounds.  I have a slim frame through, but am told, I look solid.  The only thing about the styling that I would change about this coat are the shoulders - they slump.  I expected shoulders to be stiff, straight, and sharp, but when I tried on the coat, they noticeably slump.  Nothing too awful, but takes down the look a notch.

    Shipping was surprisingly quick. The product is a little ""cheaper"" looking than we had anticipated. I purchased a large (for a friend) and to see if it would fit him for Christmas, I tried it on. It is a bit small. I'm your average American girl (size 7-8 jeans, measurements 39-27-39, weight 145ish) and it was a bit tight around my bust (friend's chest is smaller than mine so should be okay there), but I expected that. The issue was the shoulders. I have kind of broad shoulders for a girl, but this coat I can barely move my arms around.Even the sellers size chart is off, so pay attention to the comments and what others have said before you pick a size.Secondly, the materials were much cheaper than anticipated. Aside from that, everything was fine. The shipping took around 14 days, and coming from China, that's pretty good (amazon claims it takes nearly a month.)

    Folks it’s tight for women in the chest/front side. I bought a large as men’s large polos swim on me and a medium  men’s polo is “just right”, but in this case, it’s designed for a European or Asian framed male which is a “petite” for some Americans. The length is right, the shoulders/upper arms tight, and the button front exactly right or slight split/peak-a-boo area in the chest. If you lift weights or bulk up your upper chest, this will be a size constriction challenge for you. If you’re a long distance runner with a lithe frame this might be too big or bulky for you.

    The coat arrived ahead of time, to my surprise. It fit me as expected, being that I looked at the ACTUAL sizing guide. Snaps need a few buttonings and unbuttonings it work well, as with most fresh snaps. Superb, denimesque suiting material construction, with good stitching. Wouldn't load up the pockets, as location could result in bulging or hanging outside the coat. More for a phone or cards/cash. Not really for change. Coat is definitely fitted like a suit, so expect the same limited mobility issues that come with looking pimp i.e. not being able to raise your arms above chest/shoulder level (you can still play guitar way up high and DJ on a keyboard stand just fine though). Not really made for dancing, or constant wear I feel, if this is your look and want to wear it daily it could take it but would need care. Considering getting a second one and chopping the sleeves for a more casual throw-over a fishnet/tanktop look. Stock it is great for costuming and maybe taking to the club. Wouldn't recommend for a formal event, not that kind of tailcoat. It is made for what it is made for and does it well! I use it for gigs and receive frequent compliments, and have used it quite a bit (with moderate abuse) and it has held up just fine. I can also attest to its versatility for those creative in their personal fashion vocabulary. It is best paired with pants of a similar material, but many styles supported here. It can just as easily wear it with a button-up and cravat/bowtie/ascot as I can throw a scarf around it or even rock a printed long sleeve tee and have even ventured to tank top or fishnet shirt. Works amazingly with all. I continue to enjoy this product.

    This coat is quite nice for a costume piece. It does run small, so if you think you are a Large, get an XL or even XXL. The inner vest is actually part of the coat, not separate, and it buttons with snap buttons, which makes it easy to put on. If you don't like the vest, the vest flaps could be pinned back inside the coat using safety pins, and you can then wear your own vest or waistcoat instead (but you'll need to use safety pins or something else to get the vest flaps out of the way). The pockets are real functioning pockets, although not very deep, but I'm still surprised since so many costume coats just have fake pockets. Basically, this coat is a notch above most others costume coats (while still being just a costume coat).

    The size chart and lack of mention that vest is attached are the only reasons I'm giving 4 rather than 5 stars.  The jacket is VERY well made and the cloth is very sturdy,durable, thick (kind of like a denim or thick duckcloth).  I am female with a large chest and ordered 2 sizes up from the size chart provided by the seller in their description, and it fit absolutely perfectly!  It's a shame you cannot trust their chart though.  For reference, 2 sizes up is a 10""difference in both chest and waist measurements on my body.  I was a little bummed that the vest is sewn to the jacket, but it does help give a beautiful fit.  I personally plan to remove the vest since I need to for the costume design I plan to use this with.  The tails are quite long and fall just below mid-calf on me (from hipbone to floor my leg is 37"").

    The fit was great! I'm 5'10, 150lbs and got the small. It fit exactly as I wanted! The tails were not too long for me and the sleeves were just right. However, the jacket is made from a kind of heavy denim-like material so it isn't soft and very nice to the touch like a blazer or sport jacket would be. I was hoping it would have been a bit softer but I suppose that means the jacket will be more rugged and be able to withstand more abuse (not that I'll be trying to find out myself).I bought a separate waist coat to use under it, so I am either going to cut out the jacket's own faux-coat or unsnap the front buttons and pin the two sides back against the inside of the jacket. Either option is very easy to do, if you're wondering, so you can either use the jacket with the faux-waist coat or without it.All in all, a decent jacket but the price is a bit high, for me, for what it's made from. The included faux-waistcoat is a nice touch, in case you want something like that and overall it would be a good option for a vampire, magician, goth, steampunk etc. style costume.

    I ordered a size large enough to fit my chest and waist, and the vest fits very tight, but the shoulders were falling off my shoulders and the sleeves hung 3"" past my hands!

    Its a great jacket for the price. I enjoy wearing it but out of all my jackets its not my first choice. The fabric is thinner than I was hoping for but in turn it makes it pliable. The pockets are thin nylon I believe and have a tendency to stick out. Do not wear this coat on a windy day, because the sides are fastened to the vest, it blows the lapels away revealing that it is all one jacket which I find embarrassing lol. Also the wind will reveal the cheap fabric for the pockets. Once again to reiterate this jacket is pretty cool for the price. Also the snaps easily come undone and because I work out, my pecs pop the top snap off constantly lol.

After reading the other reviews, though, I went a size up and got a medium. It fits well in the chest but the sleeve are no where near long enough. If I keep my arms down, the sleeves end at my wrists with no slack to spare. If I raise my arms, the sleeves end at about the middle of my forearms. The material and overall quality, however, is very good. Others are correct that the material feels like a very durable denim or canvas. It's not too stiff, though, in my opinion. I would have given this coat 5 stars but because of the sleeves I had to give it 3. I would return it for a large coat instead but I need this for Halloween and it's currently not Prime eligible.

    The fit is great.  The fabric is slightly heavier than I expected, but I actually like that.  It does mean anything in warm weather could get extremely hot.  The only thing that takes a star off is the assembly quality.  I can't say stitching because that looks fine, but the fabric panels on the right side of the jacket for the one shipped to me don't line up on the inside and outside, which causes a slight ripple in the fabric of the jacket just above the waist that will not go away no matter what.  Otherwise, it would be five stars.

    The jacket itself is made well. I ordered a Large going off of all the reviews of it running small.Either you all don't know how to dress, or shop and big and tall becuase I am 5'6"" weighing 180lbs with minimal fat (bmi of about 10-12) and this thing was huge on me in the arms and chest when I ordered a large. Almost seems a small would fit.And now it's not on sale and I lost $10. Just follow the chart and don't listen to reviews on this thing.

    I had to shorten the tails by six inches, so suitable for someone over six feet tall. Fits loose enough to layer vest and sweater under, but my son is very thin. Length of vest section is perfect. We layered another vest and shirt under.

    I'm a tall person, so I purchased the XL knowing it may shrink a little in the wash.  After washing it fit fine except for the sleeves they ended up being a touch too short.  I didn't want to return the coat since I liked it otherwise, so I let out the cuff on the sleeves and rehemmed the cuffs, which gave me about another 1/2 inch on the cuffs.  Would still like a little more sleeve length, but now at least it does look alright in the arms and generally fits well everywhere else.

    Even though I ordered the jacket two sizes larger (XL) than My normal size (MED) it was still a bit tight. I should have ordered three sizes larger than my norm. I have to get help from my wife or someone else to get my right arm into it after I have inserted my left arm. So, I sprayed it with water and put it on and wore it till it dried on me. Now it is much better.The jacket is a nice cut and fashionable. There is no lining in the jacket. I would have paid a few bucks more for a lining. A lining in a jacket like that protects the inner fabric and also facilitates a more comfortable experience. It is also easier to slip in and out of with a lining. Unlined heavy material is kinda grabby to other fabrics.

    I'm in A Christmas Carol each year and this year the theater bought several tail coats off of Amazon and the fabric was very light and thin like the cheap costumes you get at your local shopping center. This coat is made out of much nicer thick fabric and feels like it will last much longer. I was very impressed at the workmanship of this coat.

    I love the color of this and the fit. It really hangs well on the body and doesn't feel like it was cut weird or anything. The material is a denim-like material and the purple isn't as dark as it seems in the picture, but it's still purple and looks great. It is really lightweight and something you can easily move around in. I ordered a size up (I'm 6'0"" and 215 lbs and ordered an XL) and it fits perfectly. The length is good and doesn't drag the floor.

    I am 1.87 tall and 92kg, bought the XLT and it is true to size. That matters a lot to me, because the item travels around the world and I try hard to avoid returns. This is a stylish and well cut vest. I love wearing it. Workmanship and materials are impeccable. I would buy it again. If there are any downsides I struggle to find them, but here you are: I would much prefer it was not made in China (even if that made it a little more expensive), I would prefer the zipper would join on the other side, and I would prefer it was a double zipper. That said, I still feel it worth 5 stars.

    This checked all the boxes.  I bought this for my brother-in-law for Christmas, and although a few weeks out I have never felt so positive that he is going to love it.  It has a 'lux' look with a traditional plaid interior lining, that BTW is a soft and visually just what you are looking for, making the vest perfect for the woods or that casual dinner engagement. Seriously! This is one good-looking extension to a man's wardrobe -- and there are so many pockets for the outdoors person that needs to keep his phone, keys, and wallet safe, but also the small pocket light, the Leatherman, or whatever else you need to have on your travels into the hinterlands, state and local parks, or whatever floats your favorite love's boat.  But it is also fashionable enough to make your man a Friday night talk of the town :).  I really loved this vest and will be buying it again... just figuring out who is most deserving and will appreciate it for all the finer qualities it presents!  Truly, it is worth the purchase.

    I did a lot of research on different websites looking for a vest that I could wear while ranching, fishing, or just for casual wear. Needless to say, prices vary considerably but not necessarily commensurate with quality. I initially found this vest on Legendary Whitetails' website and was impressed by its looks, style  and functionality. When I finally pulled the trigger to purchase it, to my dismay it was sold out in my size. However, I found the same, exact vest available on Amazon in my size (L) and immediately bought it.When I received the vest, I was very pleased to see that its style, appearance and quality met, if not exceeded my expectations. With its flannel lining, it's comfortable and warm but not too heavy. I'm 6' and weigh 175 lbs. and typically wear a size large in most apparel. From a sizing standpoint, I would say that this vest fits true to size (always a concern when ordering online).In summary, I am very pleased with this vest. Really good quality at a very fair price.

    This vest is real nice for the money in my opinion.  Plenty of pockets, the upper chest ones are a little on the tiny side but fit my earbuds case just fine or some chapstick type of thing. The inside chest pockets are nice, one has a zipper and the other is velcro. - My only complaint on the whole vest is that the velcro is a little too strong (this will of course weaken over time), I feel the need to hold carefully onto both sides of the velcro so as to not rip it off the flannel lining that it is attached to. The lining by the way looks great and makes for a warm vest. Definitely reccomend it to someone looking for a brown vest to add to their wardrobe.

    I love the vest. I wear it every day for work for the pockets, so I can carry stuff around with me. Being a man’s vest, I thought it would have been larger. I still wear it and chose not to return it. I just couldn’t zip it if I wanted to. I’m also a short, curvy woman, which makes a man’s vest fit differently. For a man, it may have fit perfectly😁

    I wear a Medium so I bought a Large to be roomy.  Well it is a tight fit w/o a tshirt and too tight with a shirt.  Best to wear it w/o anything underneath. Naked.  Not my choice so I went back to buy one that is 1-2 sizes bigger than their :Large, maybe an XL or a XXL.  It looks great and thin with great pockets BUT too small. Did not stretch much.  Vests normally go over something so these should be bigger to accommodate a shirt or something inside it.  So order BIGGER.

    I'm satisfied with it for the moment. My main complaints are it's a bit high priced for the quality of the materials, and it's not as comfortable as I'd hoped it would be; the material's a bit scratchy. That being said, it's light, which is good for summer walks (my intended use), and it fits pretty much right on the money. Would I purchase again? Eh...

    This item is well made and as described in photos. The zippers appeared to be slightly “underweight” for rigorous outdoor activity but problem free for everyday use. I returned it because while XL usually fits me comfortably, this item was undersized. I purchased a XXL which fit fine. It also extends past the waist to the lower hips so fit is important if you’ll be sitting with it zippered up. Also this vest isn’t insulated so it won’t be similar in function to a light sweater or outdoor fleece vests. In warmer climates & seasons it would be fine. Overall a good value for a lightweight vest.

    This review refers specifically to the basic model with three outside zipper pockets.  I placed four orders to finally get one of acceptable size.  I wear size L for shirts, vests and jackets of almost all brands. I ordered this Guiho vest in size L and received a size S in a package labeled L; the size tag had been cut out.  I ordered L again (in a different color) and received size M in a package labeled L; again no size tag.  A size XXL was too big.  Finally a size XL was satisfactory, though a bit too large.  So I have not seen a true size L.  Both the XXL and the XL had size tags.  I think the seller ran out of size L and so deceptively put smaller sizes in packages labeled L. Colors are not as pictured: the “army green” is an ugly dark greenish brown; kakhi is more yellowish brown than shown, but satisfactory.  The overall quality seems satisfactory, though I have not yet tested it for durability.  It is annoying that the zipper pull is on the left side.  The one inside pocket in the XL is barely big enough to hold a US passport; pockets are smaller in smaller sizes.  Follow up:  The vest gave satisfactory service for a week of traveling abroad.  My main complaint is about the deceptive sizing.  It could be improved by adding a large inside pocket big enough to carry a Kindle or a travel guide book.

    I almost always wear a vest over a shirt or T-shirt as a ""fat- hider"". I have a green one I like, but decided to get a second one. The one I originally bought on Amazon is not for sale anymore. I don't need a dozen pockets, just one for glasses and two side pockets for keys, etc. This vest has that. I originally bought a khaki one, but decided I didn't like the color on me so am returning. I replaced it with a gray one of the same mfr as the khaki.No mileage so far to address durability. The reverse zipper is odd, but I have that on a down coat from France, and I don't zip up very often anyway.

    On the plus side. It fits good, works great as a kind of winder breaker for the body. Looks great too. The cell phone pocket on the left chest is actually the right size to fit a smart phone. Other vests I have tried were obviously made for old smaller cell phones and too small for modern smart phones. Now the bad. The nylon shell is very thin and not very rugged. I have only had this a short time and there is already a small hole right over the cell phone pocket. The nylon is so fragile that all you have to do is rub up against something while you have a cell phone in the pocket and it wears a hole in the nylon almost immediately. So on the one hand I want to recommend this for all the good points, but at the same time discourage people from getting it due to the fragility of the materials.

    I live in a area of Southern Australia that is hot, hot, hot in Summer and very cold in Winter. This jacket is perfect for our cold nights which are around around freezing. Would not suit artic temperatures. Having said that I am very pleased with this jacket. It is a perfect fit, warm but it will still allow for layering and it has the bonus of side pockets which not all jackets of this type possess. Delivery process was super fast (order placed 11 July and received today 22nd) and having free returns gives peace of mind. (I have ordered a different brand jacket as well as this and sizing was guesswork with much disagreement in reviews about fit.) So if you are thinking of buying this jacket, order the size you usually take and I'd be amazed if you didn't like your purchase.

    Innanzitutto l'articolo corrisponde perfettamente alla descrizione, cosa assolutamente non scontata.L'esterno è in pile super morbido, l'interno una pelliccetta sintetica anch'essa estremamente morbida.I colori rispecchiano la foto dell' inserzione: io ho preso un tono su tono di grigi ed è una combinazione molto gradevole che non fa sembrare la camicia un prodotto da bancarella cinese.Il taglio è regolare e non fa l'effetto ""sacco di patate"" ma piuttosto segue la forma del corpo; corretta la lunghezza delle maniche.Attenzione alle misure: veste grande. Io sono 1.75 per circa 80 kg con fisico robusto e la taglia giusta è la M.Le tasche per le mani sono ampie e all' interno rivestite in caldo pile.Le tasche frontali sono piuttosto piccole.È un capo caldo ma non caldissimo: per temperature attorno allo zero bisogna mettere in conto almeno una termica sotto e un giubbotto sopra. È una camicia pesante, non una giacca imbottita.Soddisfatto dell' acquisto.

    I purchased two different versions of this by the same brand. The only difference is this one is a button front and the other one is a snap front. Same exact quality, material and fit. Very soft inside. Good quality material. It's not thin junk. One thing I found interesting that you need to take into consideration is that Amazon suggested that I wear a large in this model yet the exact same thing with the snap front they suggested I wear a medium. I ordered large in both and both fit perfectly. I can see the button closure being nice for a shirt but I found that the snap is much more convenient for a jacket for a quick on and off. This one was $10 cheaper but I would rather pay the extra money for the snap in the future. The only negative about the whole thing is the hip pockets are set back too far so it makes them difficult to reach in quickly. You have to feel around towards the back to find & reach them. It was a good buy. Hard to find insulated flannels anymore. These kept me warm in 30° temperatures. Perfect Fall or early Winter jacket.

 Been looking for one of these jackets for awhile came across this one on Amazon and quite like the look of it for the price. I did have some reservations though on on the size and also the material, 5 added a video review to my my review which I feel explains these in more detail. I'd say if this is the sort of product you're looking for you should go for it. It's really nice and warm great for wearing during the autumn months it's just a T-shirt like shirt underneath. I'm size small to medium usually depending on the garment I weigh about 85 kg and I'm 5-ft 9 with the athletic build. I purchased a size medium and I think it fits me perfectly so I could wear it it comfortably even with a couple of layers underneath.

    Hola, la adquirí en primavera 2023, ya con algo de calor, espere a que bajara un poco y así fue que la compre; cabe mencionar que mido 1.70, peso 68 kilos, poca panza y hombros caídos, pedí talla chica, al ponérmela me quedo ligeramente grande (menos que talla M), pensé de inmediato, la mando ajustar y listo!, pero viendo que no es tan caliente, mejor poniéndome debajo una camiseta (algodón o térmica), camisa y un suéter o sudadera, me quedaría mejor y lucio mucho mejor; al tacto por fuera y por dentro se sienten muy ricas, mi preocupación que encogiera por ser como franela por fuera y para nada (la lave dos veces para verificar) y aparte no se arruga y casi no es necesario plancharle, cabe mencionar que donde vivo es Toluca Méx, el invierno es rudo y si pienso salir con una camisa y la chamarra la pasaría mal. Si usas prendas talla Chica en la marca Dockers, RL o Tommy (todas regular), te quedara bien, o como a mi ligeramente pero muy ligero grande; en mi caso no fue problema porque a veces así vienen las sudaderas tipo chamarra. Lo único malo es que se nota que para ahorrar en la maquila, las bolsas están a la altura de la costura de las costillas y eso da como resultado que están atrás las bolsas, pero de allí en fuera se acepta la prenda. Me volvería a comprar siiiiii, en mi caso sería en colores sobrios y lisos, están padres la tipo leñador pero cada quien sus gustos.

    I work in a refrigerated warehouse but don't need long sleeves under it, and I hate the feeling of the typical nylon lining in most sleeves. This is the perfect solution to that, I can throw it on over a t shirt without needing a buffer layer. The colours look great (photographed against a hi-viz safety vest), it's soft, I don't have any immediate concerns about durability, but I'd probably buy it again just for the sleeves if something did happen to it.

    I absolutely love this coat. leaving it open, it breathes enough that in mild weather it never feels overly warm. As soon as you button it up though it creates an incredibly cozy little bubble of your body heat. The ONLY downside is the pockets. They feel a bit far back when buttoned up, but on the inside, there is only a small string connecting the bottom of the pocket to the coat. I could see it very easily getting snagged on something and once torn, the pocket will likely sag below the bottom of the jacket and look silly. I think in a future edition, it would be wise to sew the pocket onto the inside of the coat somehow. It would really make it feel much higher quality.

    I have a number of shirt jackets but by far this is the BEST in my opinion. It is well made and this thing is thick, it is heavy duty and boy does it keep you warm. It is warmer than several brands others I have bought.  It fits according to size, which is real important to me. I liked my first one so much I have since ordered two more.  So if you want a nice warm shirt jacket this is the one.

    It’s a great value. It is, hands down, the absolute, most average fabric and the cut is extremely middle of the road, but it’s essentially exactly what I wanted. You’ll love it. I bought it to fit under a denim trucker jacket and/or to be used as a house jacket. It’s great for either. I am 6’2” and about 190 and the medium is the right size for me. I first bought a large and it was really loose on me. Amazon has a pre-configured return protocol for people who buy the wrong size, so they already put the medium in the mail before I had wrapped up the large to be returned. Very efficient. The medium arrived with an air freshener fragrance, which I assume is what they do when someone returns one and they plan to send it back out. The large had no smell. I just washed it before wearing; you have to admire that they have such a robust system for returns. They can’t just throw them out because they didn’t fit. I’ll probably buy another one since it doesn’t make sense to have a sweatshirt that you’d use to wear around the house AND out on the mean streets of suburbia.

    The quality of the piece is very good and what was expected. The size did run small compared to a previous same labeled fleece purchased previously.

    I've tried 6 different zipper sweaters, and began to wonder if I was just too crazy-fussy.  This has reassured me of my sanity!  This is what I wanted.  It is soft, particularly important around the neck when the sweater has a full-length zipper.  The XL size was perfect for me (190 lbs, 6 foot, average build, with a medium-weight shirt or sweatshirt underneath.  It has a good waist length (as pictured in the ad) and good circumference for me (I have a 38"" waist).  The sleeves are not overly long; rolled up once at the cuffs was perfect.  Blue color was a dark navy blue.  The zipper was sturdy, and pulls up on the right side.  (Several of the sweaters I tried were described as ""Men's"" but the zipper pulled up on the left, woman's, side by U.S. custom.)  It is medium weight, so I can wear it around the house or outside if I feel a bit chilly.  It is not really warm or heavy for colder weather.  It has two deep zipper pockets. The price of $25 was very reasonable.  Yes, I'm happy I found this.  I will follow the washing instructions (machine wash cold; dry low) because I want this to last.

    Bought this jacket for my husband. He is about 6 ft & weighs 350, typically wears a 3XLT. I struggle to find anything with the right length & width, especially jackets. I covered my bases & ordered a 3x & 4x to see what would fit best since reviews & size chart were not helpful. I ended up sending the 3x back because the 4x fits more like a 3x. So this jacket definitely runs on the smaller side. The length isn’t bad, for most it would seem average length and material is light but warm. The husband is happy with his new jacket & it’s his favorite color.

    As a ""sweatshirt,"" I had expected the fabric to be different.  It's hard to find a sweatshirt with zipper pockets that isn't a hoody.  This is a very lightweight ""fleece"" that's moderately warm -- unless the wind is blowing.  It doesn't stop much of the wind -- so you'll probably need something long sleeve underneath.

    I purchased this vest for my husband who has been working outdoors on  a construction site. I did purchase one size bigger so it would fit comfortably overtop of a undershirt, T-shirt and a  thick hoodie. Could probably even fit overtop of his light jacket. The vest has large wide open arm holes so I guess it was actually designed to fit overtop of a light jacket..This vest is very well made. The back of it goes a bit lower I guess to cover some of the lower back  &  butt area. The front pouch style pockets are wide and deep and fleece lined.. Would easily fit a phone and other items. The inside lining is lightly padded and lining is a soft T-shirt type fabric that likely holds body heat. The outer shell of the vest is a thicker type of nylon that likely breaks wind. The zipper is sturdy and seems to be good quality zipper. The fabrics have that quilted stitching. My husband likes it very much and says its the best vest he has ever had / worn..Very well made. Well worth every penny. Made in Bangledesh - no NOT  cheap china made.I would purchase again and recommend this vest for anyone who needs a good vest for working outdoors.

I have another Dickies vest almost just like this one I was hoping to replace - it has a wonderful camo color scheme that is very attractive and useful when bird watching. Dickies no longer makes outdoor oriented clothing which is sad because the only choice of color was dark blue or black, why? Don't care about the water repellent feature because I don't wear this kind of vest in wet weather- your sleeves would get drenched.

    Light Dickies vest that has some deep but not too deep front pockets. Warm enough to wear casually around the house or during the Spring/ Fall seasons. I purchased mine at XXL so I could add layers underneath. Collar is akin to a flight jacket. One minor gripe was the lower part of the zipper was loose from the vest which was easily remedied with some thread and needle.

    Originally I ordered a large size jacket being that I am a size medium. I was going with the rule “always go one size up with jackets and coats”.  With these jackets, I would not use that rule at all.  The jacket was WAY too big on me and I had i return this hack via UPS and get a refund minus the shipping cost.Now that I have this medium size jacket, it fits almost how expected the jacket to fit.  The chest area could be a little wider, but over all, I like it.Now I live in Central Texas, it might get as cold as 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but normally not colder than that.  It keeps me warm.  It breaks the wind quite well too.  It rained today, it held up pretty good and I stayed dry.  However, I was only going from my house or store to my car.Now I’m originally from the northeastern part of the U.S.  it’s colder there and we get snow.  I would use this jacket as a spring or fall jacket in a colder climate.

    The jacket is as advertised, but the zipper is on the wrong side.  My wife didn't know what I was talking about until I showed her my other coats and her coats. Men's zippers are on the right-hand side and women's the left.  This jacket has a left-hand zipper.  Now the zipper works just fine. The coat seems well constructed, but it just feels wrong when I go to zip or unzip.I would have given it 5 stars, but the zipper thing is a standard that has been on every man's coat or jacket I have ever had.

    I am roughly 5'11"" and would wear a 3xl T-Shirt.. The upper back is pretty tight for me and so is the chest and stomach area but that could be just an issue of me being a bigger guy and shaped different. It did do its job as a windbreaker and it also did keep me warm. The whole reason why I am writing this though other than the size issue that others have warned about, which is resolved if you buy one size larger. Is the problem with warranty and support. I reached out to Pro Club through their website for support after the jacket ripped and the rep said they didnt' offer support for their products sold on Amazon. Even if you were to look at their website it looks like there isn't any warranty available on their products. I was just outside of the return policy as well. If you can get these jackets for cheap then i would say go for it but otherwise I'd stay away.Pros:- Keeps you warm- does its job as a windbreakerCons:- Smaller than advertised size[buy one size larger]- No warranty outside of return policy

    I ordered the 5xl big and tall, the 5xl was not branded tall anywhere on it. I wear a 4xlt shirt. Bought the next size up due to description saying it run small. Jacket fits like a 3xl jacket. Imagine the jacket as the sausage jacket and me as the stuffing, all of my glorious lumps and mounds highlighted for the world to see.Yes zipper is on the left, it’s mentioned in the description, big whoop.In the description it said made in USA, tag clearly says made in China.

    This is  the second such jacket I bought. The first jacket's left side pocket was left unfinished/unsewn . One's hand goes through the pocket because the bottom of the pocket was not sewn closed. Luckily, I can sew, so I went ahead and completed the work so I could have a pocket I could actually use. This is the only reason why I took off one star from the rating. The jacket is actually well made and the material is good. The fit is even better. I sized up because I like a loose jacket. I am a size 4 miss, but I ordered a medium. I like the jacket so much, I ordered a second one and the second one is perfect. The jacket is very comfortably warm.

    I ordered this jacket for my father. The only complaint he has is that the zipper is on the opposite side from any jacket he currently owns so it makes it difficult to zip up. He also has some vision impairment and that makes it a little more difficult. Otherwise, the jacket is warmer than the one he currently owned and it meets the need.

    The first clue that something is amiss with this jacket is that the zipper pull is on the left side.  This is extremely unusual for men's clothing which normally buttons or zips from the right, but women's clothing usually fastens from the left.  The proportions are also a bit screwy, particularly the shoulders which were too tight.  Women tend to have narrower shoulders than men.  It's almost as if they took a jacket pattern that was made for women and just scaled up the size to fit men rather than redesign the jacket from scratch.

    Let me be clear, the reason the jacket is too small is because it's not a windbreaker. It has the flannel lining on the inside which took up the extra space, that would make it a windbreaker.At this point it's no longer a windbreaker, because of its flannel lining it's a jacket and they did not increase the size to accommodate for the flannel which makes it too small, because it's not a windbreaker,  I know of no windbreaker with a thick lining in my lifetime of 55 years. And I have purchased many windbreakers.

    Ordered one for myself and one for husband.  Loved the jackets -- windy where we walk and sometimes after dark.  Mine broke where the zipper pull slides, completely broke out 2nd time I put it on.  Returned for credit with no problem.  Finally decided to try again.  Husband loves his.  It had one problem which turned out to be fine.  The hang tag said 2X, but sewn in tag said 3X.  Definitely a 3X and works fine. Gives him a little space to layer. Would give 5 star if hadn't had problem.

    This was the second one I ordered for my husband.  Bought a smaller one first and it didn't fit my husband, so I gave that one to our son.  I ordered the same jacket in a size larger as my husband had put on weight and this one fit just fine and he loves this jacket.  He wore it through most of the winter.  With the lining and the hood it kept him warmer than I expected a windbreaker to do.  I will try to find a lighter weight one now that spring is here and we will soon be into summer.

    It’s what I expected as far as style, you know the simple casual but neat look to it that I like about the pro club brand. It’s quite comfortable like I expected. It’s not really built for warmth but I would say as long as you have meat on your bones you’ll be comfortable in 50-65 degree weather, that’s an estimate from a person who lives in a hot environment. Not disappointed because I expected it to be light. I do still wish it was a little heavier though. Beats any typical windbreaker with no insulation.

    I shopped around looking for a lined fall coat that would keep me warm during the fall and spring.  Obviously a normal windbreaker wouldn't suffice.  This coat fits the bill.  It keeps you warm during those seasons, yet isn't too bulky or heavy.  While the  zipper is on the left side (as opposed to the right) it really doesn't create a problem.  You cannot beat the price for the quality of this coat.

    I liked the jacket, even though I ordered one to big because I was convinced by the reviews to go a size up.ordered last year in December and wore til  mid march. I pulled out of closet this winter to wear again and only wore a couple times before the zipper lost a tooth. it will only zip to that spot now, which is less than half zipped. I probably wore this less than 40 times. I realize we are a throw away economy, but I do expect clothes to last longer than this. Except for the zipper, the coat seems like a good coat.

    Nice jacket; after reading many of the reviews, I decided to size up from a Large to X-Large, and am glad I did.  the X-Large fit my husband perfectly.  I thnk the X-Large in any country other than the United States may still be smaller than an X-Large in the US.  So, I sized up and glad I did.

    Nice looking Softshell Jacket.  A little warmer than my old Columbia windbreaker.  The XL jacket fit is as described, however a little tight in the chest (I have a 49"" chest) as I am short and stocky.  The sleeves have adjustable cuffs via velcro straps.  I especially love the extra chest pocket perfect for phones.  Be careful of the main zipper coming apart at the bottom if you try to zip up too fast.  Otherwise I really like this jacket.

    I was looking for a plain jacket to use for my AEMT class and the clinicals I need to take for it. And given it is winter here I needed a jacket quick. This is lightweight and soft on the outside and very easy to move around in. No pulling on my shoulders or upper arms like other jackets do. Plenty of space in the pockets to carry my things like my stethoscope, pens, medications, and back up supplies I need to have close to me when I travel out that will not clutter up my go bag.The velcro tightening pieces on the wrists are stretchy enough for me to pull my sleeves up  on my arms incase I need to keep cloth out of the way for what I need to do. With the pockets it is a bit higher up on my torso,the bottom of the pocket the zipper did cut my fingertip and through the white of my fingernail when I pushed my  hand into the pocket to grab something. It may have been my fault on that but I wanted to make note of that . Overall I love this jacket and I hope it will last a long time during my school into my job life. And I can even wear it as a regular jacket by removing my velcro patches from my shoulders.

    Going through all the jackets available to choose from was quite a chore.  I narrowed my list down to this jacket and the Columbia Ascender Softshell Jacket (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HQ4KSMI).  They seemed pretty similar although the Columbia jacket was $11 more expensive.  I decided to order both and then choose.These jackets are virtually identical.  Here's the differences I spotted:1. The cuff on this Trailside jacket has elastic as well as velco cuff.  The Columbia jacket just has the velcro.  The problem with only the velcro cuff is that you either strap and unstrap the velcro whenever you put it on and take it off, or you live with the cuff wide enough to get it on and off and accept it the cold air from the poor fit when you wear it.  The combination of velcro and elastic cuff on this jacket solves this problem.2. The zipper on the Columbia jacket was quite stiff.  So stiff that you need to use two hands to zip or unzip it.  The Trailside jacket has an easy smooth zipper.3. The emblem.  The Columbia jacket has their name emblazoned, whereas the Trailside emblem looks like the edge of a mountain ridge.4. The Trailside comes in a ""ziplock"" like bag.  The Columbia in a thinner resealable bag (making it awkward to get the jacket in and out past the sticky edges).5. The price of the Trailside is better.

    I needed a lightweight jacket for fall and spring, and the Trailside brand doesn't disappoint. I'm not trying to make a fashion statement, just needed something to keep out the chill and serve as a shell in wind/light rain. This jacket does this perfectly.

    Fit as expected, but one of the inside pockets was ripped a little, and I am not the person who has time to resend things normally.  Thankfully a tailor in town repaired it at a fair price, but I really wish the pockets were much stronger from the start.  The hand pockets are not as large as I was expecting and could not fit my beats headphones case.  There are a couple pockets on the inside that work with it though.  The short answer, would I buy it again?  Yes.  It's seems to be very well,  I just really wish the pockets were reinforced better.  The pocket in question was the top zipper pocket.  It had a hole in its corner on the inside, letting things drop through it.  It's a very essential pocket to me, which is another reason I had it repaired asap.

    I like this as an everyday, around town jacket. The cuffs are great, with velcro and elastic they are tight and easy to get on and off. I got the lined one and it is warm, but not too warm--comfortable for 40-60 F. At this price and weight it is not an extreme weather jacket--I would not want to go work or play in the fields on a cold day (windy and < 45F) in this jacket.

    It is actually a nice jacket for the price (although, I've only worn it twice, now), and one of the few available in big sizes.HOWEVER, the video shows a completely different jacket than what I received!  There are no pockets on the sleeves or the back, and no Velcro for sticking patches.  And, yes, the other photos are more accurate!  The mere fact that they would include a misleading video like that is why I gave only three stars!

    Great coat, but after less than 4 months of wear (infrequent wear, as I live in FL and only use it for travel north) the zipper now jams often.

Later I realized that the large fits a little snug (for sweatshirt) but does have some stretch to it and fits great with most shirts such as turtle neck.The front pockets need to be lower for easy access.

    In general I like the fit, feel and weight.  But there are no chest pockets.  There is no good place for a cell phone/wallet or etc.  The upper arm pockets are ok.  The lower back ""map"" pocket is ok.  But there is no chest pocket which is a really glaring deficiency.  The liner of the hand pockets is stitched on the inside (on both sides of the jacket) in such a way as to make a very deep very narrow pocket where the inside chest pocket should be.  But this is so deep and narrow as to be virtually useless.  A small phone or small wallet could fit inside but getting anything other than a very small hand in there to dig it out would require a near contortionist.  Too bad because otherwise I would be really happy with this Jacket.

    I love this jacket!! I never take the time to to do reviews but I seriously felt like it was necessary with this one. It needed a few shrinks in the wash and dryer to get it to my specific liking as far as a more snug fit since it is a men’s jacket, but besides that.. no complaints really. When I first zipped it up when I tried it on, the zipper did a weird thing and SPLIT on me.. but it only happened once and I’m hoping it doesn’t do it again. So far it hasn’t. Seems like this jacket is made of pretty good quality for the price. I dig it. Oh, I do recommend that you buy a size up (that was the jacket can last longer anyway) though. I did, and I’m really grateful for it because it can begin to shrink after a few drys if you use high heat like I do.

    Love the coat, HATE the size. I bought, tried, and returned a 3X-tall, and a 5X-regular. 3X was too small, and the sleeves were too short. 5X was too large and the sleeves were THE SAME LENGTH as the 3X. If you have long arms, be wary.  Also, don't rip open the package that it comes in thinking it's going to fit like I did. Now I have to buy something to return the first coat in. I was careful with the second coat packaging, so I can use that for the return of the 2nd.

    This jacket has a great classic look and has kept me warm working in the 20s the last week. I've already received several compliments on the jacket's appearance and warmth. The elastic-free waist line looks better and is more comfortable than elastic. The sleeves and waist in size Large Tall are long enough for my longish arms and torso. The hood is bigger than that of any coat I've owned before and keeps out the wind very effectively. The zipper is solid and joins the hood at the top to cover your chin. The duck outer has apparently been very thoroughly ""sanded"" and is softer than those of other duck jackets i've owned. I believe it is still pretty durable but only time can tell. The Olive Black color is darker and slightly browner than pictured, a nice shade that will fade gracefully. The jacket is perfect and I hope it lasts a while.

    It is a decent jacket for now, but after a week of using it, the jacket has a tear. The tear is on the seam with the hood.  I noticed it on the second week after buying it. The tear is by the seam between the hood and the rest of the jacket. It's disappointing, but thankfully the jacket keeps me warm.

    This coat was bought as a work coat to withstand Frigid temperatures. It was first bought in an 3 XL REG and it was too big then it was bought in an 2 XLB and this one is pretty fitted with a T-shirt and hoodie. The coat was worn in -11 degrees and heavy winds and it stood up very well! The hood is over sized but not problematic. All and all a good purchase. He loves it!

    Nice jacket. Famous Dicky quality. I'm 6'  170 lbs. With long arms . and 32 waist. I bought large tall. fits a hair big on arms. The elastic wrists fit snug keeps sleeves from sliding over hands. 32 waist fits good  .34 might be snug. Also hangs down to crotch. Draw back the hood is very big will hang down in front of your eyes. Made for giant headed people.wearing a ball cap under hood helps. Not sure if just a large would fit better than large tall. I am extremely happy with this coat. Nice and warm also.

    This is the best fitting coat I have ever had, very nice looking, and kept mewarm the one time I wore it. Unfortunately it ripped the first time I took it off. It ripped dead center….top of the coat where the hood connects to coat. It ripped vertically…both the hood and the coat.

    Let me start by saying I REALLY like this jacket. It is soft and very warm, and the lining not being in the sleeves is not an issue. I think if the Sherpa lining were in the sleeves, it would be hard to get on and off. I have an unlined Carhartt jacket and I like this much more than my Carhartt. The Carhartt is so bulky and stiff it's very uncomfortable and I don't wear it much. This one, though big, is not really bulky and not stiff at all. I only gave 4 stars due to some sizing issues. I am a female and I usually wear a 2x but I ordered a 3x bc I wanted this to be loose. It is not very loose and I am glad I went up a size.  It is very tight around my hips when zipped. The sleeves however are really loose. They fall down over my hands even when snapped on the tightest snap, and I have large hands. However, it is so comfortable I don't really care about the sizing issues much. It is not flattering at all, but for a country girl hanging out at bonfires that doesn't matter to me.

    I ordered this just before we got hit with a long and drawn out winter season here in KY.  Glad I did, the jacket has held up beautifully and kept me warm many cold days.  My only wish is that they offered this jacket in a slightly larger size.  I ordered the largest they had (5X) and it fits, but is just a bit tight.  I am a big dude and have a hard time finding clothing that fits and still has a reasonable price (I know there are tons of big and fat stores, but most things are way overpriced for us big fellas - or maybe I'm just spoiled coming from a small southern town where things are just different from where I am now).Overall I am satisfied with the jacket, it's a bit small but I can fit and zip it all the way with no real trouble.  It is very warm and not too heavy.

    Got a long for the first time because they were out of the regular fit. Was a little nervous since I'm not quite 6ft tall. Its not noticably long and I think the extra length will be great for say bending over and getting that nasty draft up your back. The extra sleeve length is more fabric to keep your arms warm. I would buy this again although it seems pretty tough. I do concrete so I shred cloths up pretty fast. Great price for the product. Also.. i think they fixed that giant hood issue because mine isn't big like the ones displayed here.

    Great fit. I'm 6'4"" tall and weigh 185 lbs. I just have an issue with the fabric wanting to stall the zipper in one spot. I have figured out that pulling outward on the zipper in that short area I can easily zip the jacket up. The hood is larger than on any other jacket I have owned, but I wear a baseball or trucker's style hat so it's not a big deal. Also the hood does not have any draw strings but seems to be ok if the jacket is zipped all the way.

    Purchased this jacket for my husband who works outside throughout the winter cutting wood and clearing brush.  I was looking for a field-type jacket that was like a Carhartt, but less stiff and more wearable.  This was it.  The fit was on the money, the length was good, and there are many pockets (which my husband loves).

    I first purchased a standard Large b/c I feared the Large Tall would be too long.  After receipt the sleeves of the standard Large were too short so I immediately returned it and ordered a Large Tall.  The torso length of the Large Tall is good but the sleeves are still too short as they leave my wrists and slightly above exposed when driving a vehicle, etc.  I'm 6'0"" tall, 190 lbs, 32"" waste.  My other jackets are standard Large and do not have this same sleeve length issue.  Also the jacket I received has a bizzare odor that I cannot get rid of.  Right out of the box it smelled and that eve I hung it in our coat closet and now several other coats have that same smell.  I've washed this coat twice, treated with Fabreeze which helps mask the foul odor.  But after the Fabreeze dissapates it smells bad again.  It hangs in my cube at work and makes my cube area smell, and co-workers complain.  On one hand it's a very warm, comfortable jacket, with decent workmanship.  But the sleeve length and foul odor make it a big dissapointment.  So unless you're built like a penguin I recommend buying local so you can try it on and make sure it does not stink.

    Overall I like this jacket, it is VERY warm. I wouldn't hesitate to wear this to shovel snow from my driveway, but it's not exactly a mountaineering jacket either. It will stop some wind and rain, but not much. This is the 3rd one I've bought, and the only reason I've replaced them is because I spend so much time outside that the black coat will turn an odd red/grey, so obviously not the most UV resistant dye. On my second coat, the left inside pocket stitching came apart, so I used some fabric glue to reattach it. On my newest one,  the arms are a little short on me, and the zipper sticks about 2/3 of the way down.

    I just got this few days ago and tried it on yesterday for the first time (I ordered the long model after reading the other reviews)the size of the jacket is great, its slightly bigger (not taller) than expected, but thats not bad actually in case someone wears anything beneath it.however, the hood is comically over sized, in the photo I just simply pulled it over my head with simple motion with no adjustments what so ever, I can pretty much only see the ground couple of meters ahead of me.

    My husband wears his midweight jacket underneath, so he can take this jacket off at work, and leave the other on. He works in a dealership garage so it’s not always the warmest. He likes the the way the wrist has the band inside the outer sleeve, so you don’t get a draft up the arm.

    Nice over sleeves but a bit short over the front (large dude). Material, zipper, and weight is perfect. The hood is blizzard ready as it reaches over and hangs half way down the face line. For my size a 4XLT would fit better, but this one gets the job done with a few layers to take care of the belt line gap.

    The coat is really warm and fits me perfectly. My only complaint is the hood seems entirely too large. It falls down over my eyes. Probably won't be so bad when I start wearing my wool hat. Until then, I probably won't use it unless I have to.I don't think you'll find a warmer or better quality coat for the price I paid ($49.99). I would recommend this coat to anyone.

    I was planning on buying a Carhartt coat, as I buy from them a lot, but they didn't have a style in my size that I liked. So I took a chance with this coat, and man, it is awesome. It's warm. It's comfortable. It's got a ton of pockets (which I love). It is a little baggy or puffy, so when I had to wear a backpack or harness with it, it took a little adjusting, but overall, this coat is incredible.

    This jacket is very well made. It is heavy, durable and very warm. I live in central Ontario and we are no stranger to -13F winter temps. The sherpa lining (chest, back and hood) is very insulating and comfortable. The sleeves are heavily quilted and also very warm. I like the dual layered cuffs, keeps wind and wet out and the covers my leather gloves perfectly. Hood is a little on the large size, but manageable. I would definitely buy another of these jackets, but I have a feeling it's going to last awhile!

    The purchase of this jacket was one of my best-researched, but still worrying purchases. As it's not available from Wrangler AU I had to order in from Wrangler US. There are many lined denim or corduroy jackets about, but sizing varies considerably amongst the various brands. I currently own no Wrangler jackets to compare the new one with, and having two choices in XL (46 & 48) was slightly confusing, but welcome. My main worry was whether I needed 46 (slightly larger than my nominal chest size) or 48 to allow for layering. I ordered 46 and it was an extremely anxious (and rather long) wait for it to arrive. It fits well, the 48 would have been too big. Having recently bought an unlined jacket in XXL from a different company, which was too small for anything but summer shirts underneath, I was very relieved.I noted comments in reviews about the buttons and concur with those complaints- the button holes are indeed poorly executed  and very tight when new. One of the sizing issues I had was whether my arms would feel constricted with the lining. Many lined jackets do not extend the lining to the arms. Even with winter clothes on I could get my arms in fine with this jacket, and allowance in sizing appears to have been made for the blanket lining. I noted comments about plain grey blanket lining but mine is the red/grey mix as per product photos.The price was reasonable and compared favourably with Wrangler jackets available in Australia. Indeed, Amazon's price was a little better than Wrangler's own when USD was converted to AUD, with free shipping. My only minor complaint with this jacket would be that it looks a little too ""western"" for this urban cowboy, but it is after all a Wrangler.The jacket looks great with the corduroy collar, preferable to either plain denim or fake sheepskin, and the blanket lining is more attractive than other Wrangler jackets which have bright red plaid flannel or the aforementioned ""Sherpa"", or fake sheepskin. Overall I'm very pleased with this jacket, and can add to my collection of countries of manufacture for later ""US"" goods, for this jacket was made in Nicaragua. It certainly beats ""Made in China"".

    Great quality. Best price I've ever seen. Looks and feels great. Fully lined as expected but its light weight and warm. My teen daughters gave me the thumbs up!  I do recommend it.However, I ordered size 44 based on the size chart. I should have guessed that I would receive a 44L from a Tall and Big listing.  I thought about returning it but it fits well in the body and feels quite comfortable on. It actually works out better because the Long extends below the belt and below the wrists which keeps out the cold.

    Regular delivery option was fast.  Excellent quality of materials and workmanship. Looks great and warm enough for Canadian winters.  In my opinion only improvement would be one or two inside large pockets.  I'm a short stocky guy, about 5 ft 3in and 160lbs, jacket fits very good but with most jackets I just need to fold in the sleeves a little for an excellent fit.  This jacket is hard to find in stores but when available it is usually at least 50% more in price.

    I’m 5’10 and bought a 40. It fits exactly right. I weigh 165lbs. I could’ve even sized up to a 42. The jacket fits true to size and the sleeves and body are shorter than usual. Similar to a Levi jacket than my other flannel lined wrangler in a medium which fits larger than this. The jacket is decent quality besides the entire lining and sleeves being synthetic. The cotton shell is good. I dislike the button holes and hem because the stitching is loose all around and the button holes have lots of excess thread or aren’t cut open wide enough. So you have to burn off the excess and cut some holes a bit wider. Overall it’s alright. But it should be higher quality for the price. The flannel lined wrangler has none of these defects and is cheaper but not as warm. This collar is nice too and once it’s broken in I’m sure it’ll be great. Wrangler in 2020. Still alright. If you can find a lightly used vintage I suggest that route instead.

    Jacket fits great. The sleeves are perfect,not too long, not too short. The chest is a little loose but acceptable. Nice heavy denim. This Jacket has the true blanket lining. Wrangler sells another jacket with a ""blanket lining"" that to me is just thin flannel. The only thing I really don't care for is the collar, which is a tan corduroy type material. I would have preferred just regular blue denim. People have complained that the buttons are too stiff and they had to snip the threads in the button holes. The buttons are stiff,  but after using for a week they are starting to loosen on their own. The jacket is warm for 30+degree temperatures. Anything colder may need a heavier coat. All in all I believe this jacket is well worth the price

    I bought 2 lined Wrangler jackets at the same time, for different people. Both looked great. This one had a really coarse, rough feel to the lining. It's described as a blanket lining, & was a lot thicker/heavier than the other jacket, which has a flannel lining. It may soften upon washing, but I was leery to chance it. Nothing cozy about the fabric at all. Returned.

    The blanket sort of feels like a mixture of glue and toothbrush bristles. It’s almost a solid mass. I imagine after 8-10 washes it might be passable but I don’t see it ever being very soft. Returned in favor of the flannel lined jacket. Love the color of the denim though, but the light khaki colored collar really killed it for me. Just doesn’t look good.

    I've worn Levi's forever.  No longer interested in their newer styles and advertising.  So, trying Wrangler.  Their denim jacket is well made other than the buttonholes are too small making it fairly hard to button and unbutton, but I rarely do so anyway.  The color is darker than I expected.  I was actually looking for a more worn look.  But it's not bad.  All in all, a good jacket.

Sleeve cuffs and chest pockets use metal snaps not buttons and they are much easier to use. Color is definitely new denim blue. I'm sure it will ""age"" a bit with a few washings though.

    Had to replace my husbands old denim jacket that he had for so many years.  This is a different brand than then the other one, but looks like it.  This jacket is made very well except for the fact that when we went to unbutton to try it on we had a very had time getting the buttons undone.  Once we did I had to clip some of the threads to make it easier for next time.  On the top pockets you can see a faint line right aross, but only notice if you are looking for it.

    This is a great denim jacket.  I’ve loved my unlined Wrangler Denim Jacket for the past twenty five years, and still wear it.  But I decided I wanted to have a warmer version for cold nights or days.  I ordered this jacket and I was really happy with the blanket lining.  It’s a nice thick lining.  It’s not too bulky, but really adds warmth.  The weight of the denim jacket is nice and thick and cuts the wind pretty well.  On top of that, Wrangler denim fades really nicely over time, only getting better with age.  I really like this jacket a lot.  The lighter colored corduroy color is okay.  I would have preferred the classic blue denim collar, but the light corduroy looks a little sharper for wearing out to dinner, if that makes a difference to you.

    I purchased it for my boyfriend to replace a well broken in carhartt vest. Right away you can tell it’s great quality. I was worried at first it might have been too large, and even my boyfriend has said it was too big. Until you wash it. After that I had him try it on again without telling him I washed it and he said hey you made it fit. I also did put it up back to back to another vest he wears all the time and it aaa spot on same size. I’ve got a bad habit of shrinking things in the dryer from time to time, so I made sure I  did dry it on low, zipped up and inside out in an effort to keep the zipper straight and from ugly folds getting worked in from being rolled in the dryer, other wise I normally wouldn’t put it in the dryer.prolonged high heat can wear the elastic and metal out faster . A feature that is different than the big name brand is the collar, instead of a turn down type it’s more of an elastic ribbing. That can be nice if it you get to wearing a shirt with a collar or flannel,  there’s less bulk in the chin area, which I think enables more maneuverability without those items interfering doing some physical out door activities. The only thing it didn’t have that a big name brand did was another additional inner pocket and the outer zipper chest pocket. But I think that’s first world problems. My boyfriend is 5’11 and 200 pounds  wears large size size shirts and large size jackets and vests.i ordered what he wears. He’s been wearing it since he got it. It’s looks kinda fluffy until it’s broken in if you know what I mean.

    I like this vest.  Very comfortable for working in climates like here on the Oregon Coast, not too cold.  I did a big fence project yesterday; up and down, rolling around in the dirt, laying on the ground.  The canvas material brushed right off without a stain.  It fits a tad bigger than I had hoped.  Maybe one washing will bring it down a tad;  the insulation is quite warm and feels nice, doesn't bind up.  Certainly good value for the price point.  The competitive industry standard leader is 3x this cost.  Good deal.

    I was looking for a work “duck cotton” type vest. Was looking for something that wasn’t as stiff and expensive as Carhartt, or to thin as a Walmart Wrangler(no hood vest-the hooded vest is actually a great compromise but didn’t want a hood).  This vest fit the bill. Feels thick but not stiff. Very comfortable. Seems to run a little big(as I tried on large vest in all the varieties I tried on) and this one felt bigger. So I ordered a size down, and now I’m really happy with the fit. I’m 5’9 190lbs. Highly recommend this vest for the price!

    This vest came vacuum sealed in a bag, causing a ridiculous amount of wrinkles once opened.  I wouldn't have even waisted my time writing a review to complain about wrinkles, but I wanted anyone else who purchased this as a gift to be aware... because the care tag states, do not dry clean, do not iron, Do not tumble dry, HAND WASH ONLY. Wait, what? This is supposed to be a gift, so now I have to do some serious work to make it presentable as a gift.Outside of that, it seems very well made, zipper works great and the liner is super soft and warm. I'm sure it will be great once I get all these dang wrinkles out!

    We usually have mild winters in Puget Sound Region of Western Washington, but every so often it actually gets too cold for my usual fleece vest to keep me warm. When the temperature dropped into the low 20s last month, it was the perfect opportunity to see how effective this quilt-lined canvas duck vest would be for some hiking around town. My only concern was that it might be TOO warm...but the vest kept me comfortable without overheating.The canvas exterior is rugged and a bit stiff, though it should break in with more wear.  It fits me very well, especially around the shoulders and armholes. The ribbed collar is soft enough not to irritate my neck. I haven't worn the vest outside while it's drizzling or snowing, so I can't comment on how well it resists moisture.Only negative is that this vest makes me look even chunkier than I am, leading my Spousal Unit to claim I resemble a toasted Sta-Puft Marshmallow Man. Which made me crave marshmallows, and we all know that won't help.

    This is a big and comfortable vest. The canvas outer portion is tough as nails and will probably last a lifetime. There are two deep and roomy pockets too - deep enough for a smartphone (I keep my Kindle in one!) There are no snaps or fasteners, so they are open pockets though. There is an internal pocket too which a bit smaller than the outer ones, but still useful.  Curiously, the inner pocket has a button closure - just a bit odd in my estimation.The quilted fleece lining is plush and very warm. The vest is a great core insulator and useful both as a standalone cover on cool hikes, or a layered vest under a coat on very cold ones. I should note that although this is described as a men's vest, the zipper is on the left side.  I don't mind when zipping up, but when I unzip my right hand dominance kicks in.Otherwise, this vest is terrific.

    This vest fits my husband as expected. However, apparently a pretty big deal to him is the zipper which is on the ""female side"".He finds it really frustrating.The inside lining is very soft, and that lining is in the hand pockets also.The material feels very much like his Carhartt coats.This vest’s inside pocket has a button while Carhartt's vest like this doesn't have a button on the inside pocket.It's a pretty bulky vest compared to the other one he owns and therefore warmer, but more restrictive of his movements.He likes that the collar doesn't have a flap and is very comfortable.Overall, he would prefer the inside to be less soft and the zipper to start from the other side.**If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘Helpful’ button below.

    The vest is WAAAAY better than I expected!First, I did not realize the inside of the vest is VELVETY quilt-lined!  So are the huge pockets!The opening to the pockets is big, and the pocket itself is huge!  Plus, inside the vest, there is a big, securable hidden pocket!The neck is this cottony material that stretches but is very comfortable!  It is virtually the perfect size!I got the XXL and it has just enough room to be roomy, but it doesn't appear to be too big.  I like extra room rather than a tiny bit too tight.I compared this to big-name brands of which, I have two, and I actually like this one better!  My son has a bunch of these work vests and now he wants to still mine!  I must say, I really like this vest!  The stitching is VERY sturdy but unobtrusive.The fact that this vest is so comfortable, warm, and rugged is really value-added given the very reasonable price and the great looks!

    This vest has a warm quilted lining and the outer material is a medium weight duck cloth. It is similar to a Carhartt vest but not as stiff probably due to the stonewashed material. It doesn't have a wind flap behind the zipper and the zipper pulls from the left side which may be a little awkward for some people. Overall it appears to be well made and should be a fine work vest.

It's so similar to Car <3 brand, you can barely tell the difference between the 2 when compared side by side.But, if you look at your wallet, you'll def be able to tell the difference being as that this vest costs almost less than half of what the brand name version does.We applied additional scotch-guard but because my dad wears it on a regular basis, it still needed to be washed after a month of use.  It washed up perfectly.  No fade, no shrinkage whatsoever.  We hung it on a hanger to dry, not in the dryer.Our entire family has always been big Carhartt fans, and continue to be, but this vest is a solid choice as well .I hope you like it as much as my dad does.  :)Thank you for reading.

    This vest completely blocks the wind. The hand pockets are lined with sort of a crushed velvet material; super warm. The zipper is tough and made of metal, not plastic. The inner pocket is fully enclosed with a button so nothing will fall out. All the stitching and workmanship is good on it. Even with just a t-shirt underneath, it keeps me warm in 40º to 50º temperatures. If it's windy, I'll throw on an outer jacket with it. I'm wearing a size XL in the photos.

    Pedí este producto de manera anticipada, aún no empezaban las lluvias, apenas había llovido pocas veces por lo cual no había sido posible poner a prueba el producto. Sin embargo hoy, con una lluvia moderada pero constante, demostró su efectividad. En mi traslado a pie de mi casa a la oficina, aproximadamente 10 minutos. Llegué completamente SECO (al menos del torso, que es la parte que cubre) En realidad parece mágico, las gotas de agua resbalan, no penetran la fibra. El producto es 100% ligero, fácil de guardar/transportar. En cuestion a la talla, generalmente soy talla mediana, sin embargo estuve leyendo las opiniones de otros compradores y con base a ello pedí una talla mas chica, entonces pedí TALLA CHICA AUN SIENDO MEDIANO y para mi sorpresa (positiva) me queda a la perfección. Así que efectivamente pidan una talla mas chica de preferencia, por otro lado cabe mencionar que esta talla a pesar de ser mas chica de lo que normalmente acostumbro y de que me quedó bastante bien, estoy seguro de que me da todavía la oportunidad de usar alguna chamarra por debajo, en caso de ser necesario, aunque es importante mencionar, que la prenda no permite que salga el calor de tu propio cuerpo, por lo cual, a pesar de ser tan delgada, no sientes frío, pero no se debe meramente a que sea una prenda caliente, sino que se encierra tu propio calor, mientras que te lo pongas cuando aún estás seco, cumplirá su función a la perfección. Otros momentos en los que he tenido la oportunidad de probarlo han sido en carretera en moto y tambien se ha desempeñado de manera cabal.

    This is a great jacket that I use for travel as it folds flat and takes up no room.  I don't usually use the pouch, but it's there if you need something that hides in your backpack until ready.  My only problem is that I live in a tropical location with plenty of rain, so everybody steals my jacket so that I can rarely find or use it.

    This is the windbreaker I grab when I'm heading to an outdoor event with a small possibility of some rain. It's lightweight, packs up reasonably well, and has a roomy fit. It's not plastic like a real raincoat, and I wouldn't expect it to keep me dry in a downpour; it's just a layer between you and the damp of a windy drizzle.I prefer this Men's fit because it's easy to pull on and off without yanking up all the clothes I have on underneath. I like the material, which is more like a normal fabric than your typical rain gear. The hood is roomy enough to hold all my hair, loose or in a ponytail. The one thing I don't like is the amount of “noise” this windbreaker makes: any movement, large or small, generates a loud swish-swish-swish sound! People definitely will hear you coming long before you arrive!

    This windbreaker fits well.  I've worn it in light rain a couple of times and it has done a good job of keeping me dry.  It's light weight and easy to pack.  My only quibble is the label flap on the back of the neck.  For reason I understand, they didn't want to sew the label onto the inside of the back panel of the windbreaker.  It would have created an unsightly seam conforming to the label on the outside of the back panel.  This could also have been another seam that allows water infiltration.  However, their solution was to sew an extra fabric panel on the inside that shares the seam between the hood and the back panel.  Onto this they sewed all the labels.  It actually looks very nice.  However, when you pull this over your head, this flap, only secured on the top seam, often flips up outside of the neckline.  It's easily tucked back in.  But, it's a minor nuisance and something that could have easily been solved by printing the label onto the inside of the back panel fabric rather than using a separate label that requires sewing.  If not for this, I would give it five stars.  It's a very good product for the money, just not an excellent one due to a design decision.

    I am a 5'7 ~160 lb woman and the small fit well, if not a bit big. Definitely room for layering.The jacket seems decent, though I doubt it would handle much more than a sprinkle of rain. It is quite plasticy smelling, which I anticipate will fade with wear. The material is soft and flexible. Packs into its own pocket, and is fairly small and lightweight (easy to throw into a backpack or with camping gear). Overall, I am pretty happy with it, but I do think it is a bit overpriced for a polyester shell. We will see how it stands up over time.

    This anorak is great! I’m bit of a stocky short guy and I wanted a bit of a looser fit because this was gonna be something I threw on top of a button up shirt/crewneck sweater, so I got an XL and it fits great to be honest. It’s a lighter anorak, but I feel like it’s still thick enough to keep you warm if you wear enough inside. If you wear this during a summer rainy day over a tshirt it should be more than enough tbh.

    I was wanting something that wasn’t  bulky and comber some, which this jacket is neither.  It’s dressy enough for just about anything and perfect with just a pair of jeans and a nice shirt.  Warm enough to work in cooler temperatures, but not in super cold, 30 and below...but what is?  The extra inside pockets are perfect.  At first I didn’t think I would like the reverse flap front “Hand” pockets, but they are actually very good and come with a single snap. Things don’t fall out of the front pockets like money and keys when you sit down and if you were concerned about someone pick pocketing you, they would definitely have a more difficult time.

    Poor build quality and customer service policy.  I just got this vest and after the first wash (per the tags washing instructions) a seem is torn.  I called Carhart customer service.  They are having me send mine back so they can inspect it and determine if it is a defect or not.  If they determine it is a defect, then they will send me a new one.  This whole process is expected to take 2-3 weeks.  This really surprises me for Carhart and the price paid for the product.  I would have expected that they would send me a new one, then I send mine back.  Not happy that I will be without this for a few weeks.

    I wore this throughout the fall and spring, and even during the winter under a waterproof shell a few times. I have zero complaints. It fits well and keeps me warm enough without making me sweat. It's nice enough that it doesn't look out of place worn over a button up shirt, but it's tough enough to split wood on the weekends without me worrying about destroying it either. Great vest!

    I’m a carhart guy and have everything from socks to hats. I really went back and forth on this. Was not sure I needed something for those times a jacket is too much etc.  Got this today and am really happy I took the leap. High 40s today and perfect for outdoor work. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for. Feels good and looks good. A great addition by itself or as an extra layer.I’m 5’10, 180lbs and got a large. Fits perfect.@@Update- 1-22-19 I’m at Hatteras Island at the Outer Banks doing some “work”. Cold and windy. Wore this “working” outside with 37 degree temps and windy. Great wind breaker and the parts the vest covered felt good. Happy with my purchase.

    Breaks my heart to give 3 stars and not 5. It was tough to find a vest of this type that doesn’t bull on neck hairs if you don’t shave everyday, but this one does the trick. Now, for why it’s 3 stars. The Major draw back is the stitching. I’ve worn this maybe for a few months now, generally late at night as an extra layer when walking my dog. With literally NO labor performed wearing the vest, not even snow removal from a car, and stitching throughout has begun to pull. I haven’t washed it yet either, so I’m not really sure what can contribute to this. Sad as otherwise it is a perfect vest, but within a year I’d imagine it’ll be frayed all over, which seems fast for the price.

    Carhartt is so hard to judge on size especially for men. This vest size fits as specified size. The length comes down a little past where belt would sit on waist and is bit baggy hair heavy like some of the other vests. This vest is great quality and will definitely keep you warm it light enough to wear in mid range weather. Would definitely bug again.

    This is one of my favorite vests but I always leave my Carhartt shirts untucked but I just wish the length was longer.  It is longer in the back but the front is really short.  I still wear it and just live with it but this would have been a five star if they offered a big and tall longer option.  Most of my other vests are longer in the front like I like but definitely worth getting.

    My brother-in-law had bought this before Christmas and when I saw it, I had to have it!  It has pockets in all the perfect places: left breast side (outer and inner!) and two on each side.  I'm always in-between a men's L and XL and the same holds true here. The Large fits as I would expect, not a lot of extra room, but I can zip it and feel good wearing it.It's very lightweight so not for a ski day or a sub zero day but perfect accent or layer.

I ordered a medium, which makes it nice for using as an under layer, but as an outer layer, I have to tuck in my shirts or else they will hang out the bottom.

    The Columbia vest - as well as the Mountain Full Zip - are very nice and comfortable products - which most of the reviews agree with - However, I'm writing this review to talk about sizing - as few reviews actually deal with this very important aspect of any online purchase.  So I wish more people would post their height and weight and what size worked well for them.  With the vest and the Mountain Full Zip I actually ended up purchasing a medium in both styles - even though I normally wear a large in just about everything else.  For the record, I'm six feet tall and weigh 182 pounds - and the mediums fit perfectly.

Fits perfectly, and unlike other vests I own, it has a bit of contour so it doesn't look baggy, plus the collar folds down neatly, which I much prefer over the stand-up type. The fleece is mid-weight, smooth textured, and attractive.  I recommend these.

    This vest is as soft as a baby blanket and as light as a feather. It is more of what I would call a ""slim fit"", which surprised me actually. Although, I was hoping for exactly that.

    I bought this vest as a ""spare"" to keep at the office. Here in Southern California, spring and autumn days can feel deceptively warm, only to cool down quickly to 60 F or below after dark. I have a habit of forgetting to bring any outerwear with me to the office, except in winter, and then wishing I had something light to wear for warmth if going straight from the office to a meeting or dinner or other social engagement. In this climate, a fleece vest passes for ""outerwear"" for all but the three coldest months. I have an older Element Red vest from Columbia, received as a gift many years ago, which has stood the test of time, so I thought I'd order Columbia again.Cost is reasonable for quality and priced perhaps 20-25% less than the famous outfitter from Freeport, Maine charges for its equivalent product. Fabric is soft and comfortable, not scratchy. Detailing is nice with two zip pockets, a collar that may be worn flat or straight up, and a hanger loop---a feature that my old Columbia vest lacks. Fit tends to be a half size larger than usual, so that my Large feels halfway between L and XL. If you want a trim fit, consider one size smaller than you usually order. On the other hand, if you want to layer it over a thermal top or sweater, buy your usual size and you'll appreciate the fuller than usual cut. Another plus is that it's offered in a dozen different colors, which again presents more choices than the competitor from Freeport.

    We bought this as a gift but have received details of this item from the recipient. My FIL said this fits great and keeps him very warm.  He is a fairly large man and coats and jackets can be quite cumbersome. This vest was able to keep him warm enough on his recent trip to the mountains without being too bulky.  The color goes with every color imaginable. My husband has already requested we buy him one for himself!

    This is a great vest at a great price. I live in Colorado and use them for work (over a untucked button down), skiing (as a layer), and sometimes over a long sleeve thin shirt.So sizing... I'm 6'2"", 160-175lbs, I'm guessing thin cut. Normally wear mediums (sometimes larges) in t-shirts which aren't too tight, but also not too loose on me. I bought a medium and a small in these vests... The medium works although slightly loose for my tastes (ok for work, but would bother me while climbing or being active). Surprisingly, the small feels right, not too tight, loose enough to move all around. Pretty solid.

    Columbia almost never makes mistakes. I have a very old Columbia fleece vest that this one is replacing, and decided to go tall for the butt coverage. I'm 6' but not heavy or heavily muscled. The L/tall was a snug fit and its armholes were much smaller than my old vest, impinging on shirtsleeves. The XL/tall is perfect. If you don't want a snug fit, size up.

    Just what I needed. It's a nice light shell that has excellent waterproofing. Easy to bring in a backpack if you're not sure if it's gonna rain. I haven't had any issues with the waterproofing and I stood at the bottom of a large waterfall and god sprayed for a solid 15 minutes and didn't feel any soak.

    Good fit, as expected.  Color is ""Fiery Red"" and it is a pretty vivid red, good for visibility in the dark, is true to that shown in the color options.  Cuffs are decently elasticized to limit wind and water entry.  Only two pockets, external and zippered, sufficiently sized.  I wish there had been an internal pocket.  Jacket features a main zipper all the way up to the full collar with four long, intermittent strips of hook and loop on the flap to limit water and wind reaching the zipper.  The collar has a thin felt layer for comfort against the neck and chin.  The non-removable hood is plenty deep, yet not overly so and does not obstruct level vision, and folds to store in the collar.  The jacket has an interior mesh lining to assist ventilation.  The hood and and waistline have drawstrings for sizing and limiting wind and rain entry.  The North Face logo is of the same color as the jacket, so is not very noticeable.  Some people might prefer it to be of a contrasting color, but that might require a different material that might create opportunities for water leakage.  The seams are tape-sealed.  Overall workmanship appears to be good.  I had purchased two other name-brand rain jackets but returned them for issues like excessive hood depth, excessive cuff openings and ""sticky"" urethane feel.  Although they had features that were attractive, overall they were not as satisfactory as this The North Face rain jacket.I've only tested this in light rain, so after a good, hard rain I'll hopefully enter a very positive rating on that final aspect.

    In Tidewater Virginia we have wide ranging weather.  We have a saying, ""if you don't like the weather wait a few days it will change.""  This unlined jacket is perfect.  Unlined is perfect for the 90+ degs summers and layers underneath for days like today, 13 degs.  Stops the wind and driving rain for when hurricanes skirt the coast.  Well made, could use some internal pockets for cell phone etc..

    I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He opened it and seems to be very happy with it. Me on the other hand think it runs a little small on him. But he says it is perfect. 2XL fits him (in my opinion tight) But he said right on the money. So I guess it was a good choice for the money. It seems to be made well and the leather straps on the sides seem to be thicker then what others have said them to be. So I am satisfied if he is happy with it. Good Price worth the money

    I'm 6'3 180# and needed a close fitting vest over a light weight shirt.  I tried the small and found it to be too loose.  The x-small fit me perfectly with the side lacing fully tight. Docking 1 star because of the poor quality side lacing.  The lacing was leaving black dye marks on hands and clothes.  I removed the lace to clean it a bit and it broke with very little force applied.  I replaced the lace with a 60"" black hiking boot lace and am happy with the solution.  Except for the lace, I've been impressed by the quality of this vest.

    Great leather vest for the price. 4 pockets (2 outside and to big ones inside). Not strong smells as other reviews on different vests than this one. As in most vests, order one size up, even though the LEATHER laces will help to tighten the vest. I wear a size 44 jacket and I would normally would wear a L vest, but I ordered an XL and it fits perfect. Arrived promptly with 2 day Prime shipping in a large, flat box without being folded, great for a leather garment. The leather itself is not as soft as napa leather, but more to a stiffer texture, not too thick, not too thin, which I don't think is a problem on a biker's vest. I was also able to sew 4 patches with a household needle and black thread slowly, but without any issues, even though it was difficult being leather.  It also comes with a black satin liner and bronze snap buttons. Overall, very satisfied with this purchase, especially at $29.99.

    Pleasantly Surprised.  I purchased this mainly to put together a Machete costume, so I didn't want to spend much money.  For $30.00 with Prime shipping, it was perfect.  I ordered a Large and it's true to size.  The leather quality seems good, it's not motorcycle jacket thick,  but thick and heavy enough that you won't think it'll fall apart on you.  The laces on the side are leather straps.  It has a satiny black lining and 2 large interior pockets.  Looking at it, I would think it worth at least twice what I paid for it.

Afortunadamente las correas laterales dan pie a que se pueda ajustar a la medida exacta. Buena calidad en la piel y en el forro y tiene 4 bolsillos, dos exteriores y dos internos de mayor tamaño.

    We had ordered a childs vest for our grandson for Christmas, but fearing it would be too small as it was Asian sizing we decided to order this one in the smallest size, it was too big, BUT he will grow into it.

    These are ok vests but are thin leather that is actually not jet black.  It looks almost dark brown in sunlight.  The leather tassels on the sides that are woven in are not my kind of style.  The vest is adjustable which is nice and you can't beat the price but they just don't look good on a bigger guy like me with a small waist and wider shoulders.  They balloon out on the bottom which isn't comfortable on the bike and looks like an old man vest.  Maybe that's good for some but not for others.  Amazon and the seller were great with returning.

    as a whole, the vest is fine, a bit stiff but will get softened with time. the only thing I am sorry about, is that I didn't go with my gut feeling and order XL. I shd have taken the large instead. the XL is a bit big, but to look on the bright side, once I put on the patches on it, it will surely go above my jacket...so I am fine with it as is.

    This vest is the worst leather garment I’ve purchased but for the price I thought I would try it but I was very disappointed I should have returned it but I didn’t the leather is stiff and the arm areas cracked when I rolled it up to fit in my travel bag. I don’t recommend it to anyone. Junk!

    Most of my clothes clome as a medium fit but this jacket has long sleeves so the sleave part wraps over the cuff. Maybe a small would have been better for me, but I've worn it now. Also the zip is a bit difficult and the pockets have only top entry so you can't easily put your hands in them. Well made but I would have bought a different one had I been able to see more than a photo or been able to try it on.

    sehr leichte Jacke, die sehr gut sitzt und einen durchaus hochwertigen Eindruck macht. Allerdings ist die Verarbeitung  nicht einwandfrei. Einige Fadenreste, die das Auge stören, kann man problemlos abschneiden. Die rechte Innentasche war zugenäht, auch ärgerlich.. Allerdings kommt stellenweise das weiße Innenfutter nach erst kurzer Tragezeit durch, das sollte nicht sein. Angesichts des Preises  kann man aber auch keine Perfektion erwarten... Also durchaus eine Alternative  zu etwa dreimal teureren Markenmodellen, schöne äußere Optik, aber mit den erwähnten Einschränkungen bezüglich der Verarbeitungsqualität.

    My German husband often wears trachten (German/Austrian traditional clothing), but was looking for something extra to wear over his shirt in winter.Anyone who's ever bought trachten will know that it can be hugely expensive.  So this was a bit of a speculative purchase to see whether he'd enjoy wearing a traditional waistcoat.It has been a great success, in that it fits well, is comfortable and looks good.  The only criticism that I would possibly offer is that the 'velvet' material is not of a particularly high quality, but then that's to be expected for the very affordable price.Now that I've had a good experience of this brand, I'd probably choose to make future purchases from their higher priced range, knowing that it would be worn often (and thus justifying a greater cost).This would also be ideal for someone looking to buy this as a novelty item for an event such as Oktoberfest.

    Die Samtweste Ricardo von Stockerpoint hat eine gute, wenn auch geradlinig breit geschnittene Passform, jedoch lässt sie sich mit dem Einstellriegel hinten leicht taillieren.Insgesamt wirkt sie hochwertig, ist natürlich dem Preis entsprechend nicht ganz so hochwertig verarbeitet wie deutlich hochpreisigere Samtwesten anderer Hersteller.Für das Fest im kleineren Kreis oder um die Tracht allgemein etwas aufzuwerten ist sie allemal gut, zumal nicht so viel kaputt geht wenn sie dann doch mal verfleckt.Für Hochzeiten (als Bräutigamm), Staatsempfänge o.ä. würde ich sie nicht empfehlen. Da rentiert sich meiner Meinung nach die Investition in ein teureres Modell von diversen namhaften Trachtmodenherstellern.

    Ich hab mich für die „Stockerpoint Herren Weste Ricardo Trachtenweste“ entschieden, da ich für das nächste Frühlingsfest und Oktoberfest  (nach Corona :)) eine neue Samtweste brauchte.Positiv:  + schöne satte dunkelrote Farbe (siehe Fotos)  + Knopfleiste mit matten Metall Kugelknöpfe – so wie ich's mir vorgestellt habe  + passt mir perfekt – sonst habe ich ebenfalls Größe 50 bzw. Größe M  + sehr gute Verarbeitung  + 100% Baumwolle. Das Innenfutter ist aber aus 100% Polyester (siehe Foto)Neutral:  o  lässt sich natürlich nicht in der Waschmaschine waschen – was ich mir eigentlich auch dachte. Auf der  Beschreibung ist aber „Pflegehinweis: Maschinenwäsche“ angegeben. Hier muss der Verkäufer aus meiner  Sicht nachbessern!  o die Taschenschlitze sind nur zur Optik und können nicht als Tasche genutzt werden. Mir war das bewusst,  da es bei meiner jetzigen Trachtenweste genauso ist – sollte man aber beim Kauf wissen :)Die dunkelrote/ bordeauxrote Samtweste lässt sich sehr gut mit einem weißen Hemd mit Stehkragen kombinieren. Ich bin hoch zufrieden und kann die „Stockerpoint Herren Weste Ricardo Trachtenweste“ weiterempfehlen.Ich hoffe, dass ich euch bei der Entscheidungsfindung etwas helfen konnte :)

Die Weste passt wie angegossen, ist sehr angenehm zu tragen und sehr schön verarbeitet.

    Schöne u. funktionale Weste mit hohem Kragen, der gut vor Wind schützt.Sie könnte zwar etwas länger sein, aber so kann man sie auch noch gut unter einer Jacke tragen, da sie nicht ganz so dick ist. Das macht sie sehr vielseitig einsetzbar. Columbia fällt i.d.R. etwas größer aus - was ich gut finde. Ich trage normal XXL, hier passt XL optimal. Für alle, die eine coole, nicht allzu dicke Weste suchen, auf jeden Fall eine gute Wahl. Der Preis geht voll i.O.

    I have bought quite a few Columbia clothing items over very many years. They used to be very expensive and very high quality but not so much now. However, they are still very good value for money, well thought out reliable garments.This vest is what I expected from Columbia. Well made, good detailing and the right size.I easily overheat so struggle to get my layers right, so this was a nice compromise for wearing under a waterproof outer layer. It is also good to wear on a train or in a car where you want a little extra warmth.

    Veste d'assez bonne qualité, avec de bonnes finitions.En revanche, 2 points négatifs si on la compare aux vestes polaires que Columbia a fait par le passé :- elle est relativement fine et elle est même plus fine que les polaires de la marque Amazon ;- la qualité des fermetures éclairs est satisfaisante, mais en nette baisse.Par rapport aux polaires de la marque Amazon, le col est mieux car haut, bien épais et donc plus chaud.

    I bought it mainly to wear in the office. I am usually cold with the AC turned on. A jacket is usually too much and I like my under arms to remain free. I would like it to be a bit thicker/warmer, but for the price I paid for it, I like it. Also with most other vests or even shirts or jackets, I fall just in between small and medium, the size chart for Columbia products is different and that is one of the reasons I chose it, and I like the fit. I am about 5'9"" and 160lbs so the small size was just right.

    Columbia Men Fleece Vest Fast Trek:  buono  il capo,  un  po'  meno  la  cerniera.Smanicato  in  pile a  collo  alto,  da  mezza  stagione,  vestibilità  regular,  disegnato  come  capo  esterno, molto  morbido e  discreto,  utilizzabile  anche  come  gilet  da  mettere sotto il  giaccone.Due  ampie  tasche  frontali e  una  Napoleon sul  petto  per  lo  smartphone,  tutte  con  zip;  low  in  lavatrice  e  asciugatura  naturaleMolto  scomoda  la  chiusura;  premesso  che  sono  già  abituato  alle cerniere  all'americana,  con  aggancio  sulla  sinistra,  ma  questa  è  proprio  cervellotica  e  ci  vuole  un  attimo  per  indovinare  la  manovra.Buono  il  prezzo (scontato),  secondo  me  derivante  dal fatto  che  è  un  fine  serie  (infatti  mi  pare  che  sia  in  esaurimento  anche sul  sito  della  Columbia).Eccellente,  al  solito,  la  Prime  con  domiciliazione, se  volete,  sul  Locker.

    I like it. I bought the size L for a snug fit (44 inch chest) over a polo-shirt  when bike riding in the morning or evening chill. It's great for the task. Flexible and snug but not too tight. The thing is I would like to buy a size XL too for other occasions but I notice the price of the XL at this review date in early June 2022 is £40.63 when all the other sizes, even the XXL, are priced around the £28 mark. There can surely be no justification for ""discounting"" (hmmn..) all sizes except one  ..perhaps the size that sells the most?  Needless to say I won't be buying an XL unless the discrepancy disappears. Otherwise though a great feeling, soft & flexible product that I recommend.

    I sent this back as it was toooooo o big for me. I would say it fits slightly bigger than you expect, which you want as you may want to wear a jumper under it but I went a full size up and it was a tent on me.It's actually quite long too which I am not sure I liked. There is some sort of lining in this too which means it basically reflects your body heat back at you and helps to retain it, you are your own heating. It's a good idea but I would think that unless it is many minus degrees this would be complete overkill in most of the UK. Best for very cold temps.Overall though from what I saw of it the quality seems decent and the design is fine except for the general sizing weirdness

    Overall this is a decent padded vest - it stays warm in cooler temps and is fairly lightweight. The odd issue is that it's very long for a men's vest. I wear a Large, and I'm 6 feet tall but this vest goes past my butt and ends at my upper thighs. I double checked to see if I got a Tall version by mistake but the size is just a standard L, so it's the design of the garment that is about four inches longer than comparable vests for men.

    Really chuffed with this - the shiny/reflective inside material really seemed effective, feeling warmer than you'd think for the thickness. Not sure I'd want to do any physical activity in it for the same reason (would imagine overheating), but great for general use.For size ref, I'm 5'10"", fit-ish 13 stone (not fat), and got a large. It was great for going over a few layers/hoodie, but would be too big if just going over one or two thin layers. Would get a medium for that. It's also quite long in the body.

    Habe den Artikel aufgrund einer Empfehlung im Freundeskreis bestellt. Was soll ich sagen. Beste Weste für mich. Sehr leicht und die Omni Heat Technologie von Columbia ist top. Obwohl beim Tragen aussen alles kühl ist, fühlt man sich beim Tragen schön gewärmt. Aber ab -5 Grad sollte man sich mehr drunterziehen oder auf eine Jacke wechseln ;-)  ansonsten 5 Sterne.

    I originally ordered the Columbia Voodo 590 vest in large. Read all the reviews. Knew there was an issue with the vest running large. I'm 6'2'' and 198 lbs. Lean, no paunch. The large was too big. There were gaps at the shoulders and under the arms. A vest has to be reasonably snug or there's no point in wearing it. Had tried the Columbia Powder Lite in a couple of stores but they only had camo. Ordered it in large, black. Fits perfectly; warm. Runs a little long but that's fine. Seems to be as warm as the Voodo and cheaper.

    Uso normalmente la talla L en todas las marcas y con Columbia me toca la M. En este modelo de chaqueta la L se queda muy larga de mangas y anchísima y la M se ajusta más de mangas y pecho pero en cintura pasa a ser estrecha. Un desastre. Columbia tiene un lío entre modelos de chaquetas y otras prendas que hace que siempre tengas que probar porque no hay dos tallas que queden igual de bien. Por lo demás, es una chaqueta bastante fina a poner o debajo de otra (por eso se llama ""down"") o a usar con poco frío.

    I am by no means a barber, but I do cut a lot of hair on a weekly basis. Before I bought this jacket I was using nothing and it bothered me that I got so much hair on myself from cutting hair after a long day at my normal job. I wanted to order something that not only kept the hair off me, but provided that ""Barber"" feel to my customers with a couple pockets to keep my brush and comb in. I found this on Amazon and it fit perfectly. The color in the picture is true-to-life. Now when I cut hair, people compliment me on how much I look like a real barber and I am very satisfied after removing the jacket...no more hairs!!!!

    I used this smock for just over a month, and in that time there was constantly threads coming off and the seams were clearly weak. it ended up ripping up the left side all the way up to the armpit. unfortunately it happened 3 days after the return window closed so this was a complete waste of money.

    It looks nice and fits great. What more can you ask for in a work smock? A zipper that works right. The one hitch with this smock, at least with the one I got, is that the zipper constantly gets caught in the edge of the fabric along the zipper head. That flap edge need to be either longer to overlap the whole front, or shorter. One or the other would get the edge out of the way.

    I'm sorry, but what is the point of a barber smock if hair sticks to it like flies on poop?  Terrible choice of material for a hair person.  Guess it would be okay for a different profession, but no barber with a brain wants to be stuck in greasy customer hair.  Will have to purchase an entirely different smock  elsewhere.Also, the sizing is poor.  I order 3x on smocks so they're loose, and this is barely 2x, maybe not even quite.

    Love the look! Seems to be good quality. Nice brass YKK zipper. I’m 5-7 165lbs, and a medium fit perfectly. Mine needed a good ironing as it had some serious wrinkles- make sure to start with low heat and increase as needed- the synthetic material will “burn” fairly easily if the iron is too hot, in the form of a shiny imprint. This jacket is pretty warm- good for near freezing up to 60s.

    Jacket fit is perfect and as expected. To those reviewers claiming arms are too big—> it’s a men’s work jacket, not a piece fashion clothing. It’s made to work in so skinny arm-ed, bird chested people may want to look elsewhere. If your proportions are normal, it’ll fit just right, just follow the chart. Large fits me just right, I’m 185# and 5’-10 1/2”.I’ll probably buy another whenever I can, it’s a good deal for a quality piece of work clothing.

    Used by master automotive mechanic. Nice to the touch and flexible to give good comfort level. Tough enough for the harsh shop conditions. It's very similar to the Dickies product being a light enough weight to fit your arms up in a vehicle being worked on yet just warm enough to go outside in New England winter. Works great 30f outside to 60f inside shop. I recommend it. I've used Dickies and other work gear outfitters. This jacket is at least as good maybe the best yet.

    Mine came pre-wrinkled with one collar that sticks up like a cow lick.  The sleeves are huge (I can fit my leg through it) , but I don't think the cuffs were actually ever meant to be buttoned up, because if you do you won't have enough room to put your hand through it.I would pay good money for a jacket in this style with a good fit and construction, but this is not that. This is more like something you wear when painting or working in a warehouse.

    This is the best lightweight jacket you can buy. The best at being light but keeping your warm. Most automotive shops have this jacket with their logo/badge on it and their uniform color. This jacket could use an inside pocket or two, but that's not a legitimate reason to complain. This jacket is good for work and for casual wear. It resists dust and oil better than any other jacket I have tried. It also looks great when washed and washes easily in the washer. It is a polyester blend, so it does not shrink. Like all clothes, I wash before wearing, and I recommend you do for this because it will soften the cotton portion of the material. It also will remove any chemical smells to make the jacket obviously smell better. I could sleep in this jacket it is that comfortable. I cannot recommend this jacket enough. If it had inside pockets, then this would be the perfect jacket. I would even wear it in the summer for my EDC if it had inside pockets.

    I like the fit and feel of the jacket. I'll wear it in thorny brush and expect it will hold up well. It lacks an inside chest pocket; I valued the one in the jacket this one replaces. This one also lacks a hanging loop inside the collar. It tends to slide off the hook I hang it on. The jacket's upper arms are roomy and don't bind.UPDATE: In its first field outing, this jacket slid well through the prickly roundleaf greenbrier. It snagged some on raspberry canes and multiflora rose stems, but the shell fabric didn't tear. With all the polyester in the thread, the fabric has a more slippery hand than 100% cotton canvas would, but it resists tears and ""picks"" almost as well. I'm pleased with it.

    I'm 5' 10"", 180 lbs. and the Large fits perfectly. It seems very well made but it did need washing first, as it was very stiff out of the package.No shrinkage after washing & drying, so that's good.My only gripe would be is that the sleeves seem pretty large, really wide. But not that big of a deal.I'd buy another in a different color.

    This quality of this coat is great for the money. I am a short stocky big guy (3xl) and certain coats do not fit. I sadly returned mine for the following reasons. 1. Shoulders were to wide for my build. Also the cuffs were to small around my wrists. Fit well around my gut however. Also my buddy has the same one and it fits his build perfectly. So bottom line try it, great value for the money, just be aware it may not fit everyone.

    I received my first jacket at my job. 7 years of being my go to jacket, it has been great spring and fall. Winter time on top of a nice hoodie and thermal shirt, you're good to go.Not overly thick but that's what I like most. It is still plenty warm and blocks wind and light rain. It is comfortable enough to become my cats favorite nap spot so I'll take her word on that.For 7 years of use, I still use it, have only had to replace 2 plastic buttons over the years, both on right sleeve which I use more, so that's understandable. Plenty of other buttons on jacket you don't really need so use one of those for the important one if it breaks. I wash it in washing machine and dry in dryer, nothing fancy just throw it in with other clothes. It is actually remarkable how well it has held up, which inspired me to order my own without the work insignia or my name sewn on. And in a color I wanted. I checked the label on my work coat, saw Red Kap, and started my Amazon search to find the right one (slash pocket jacket) I already knew a large fit me perfect (6' 0"" 165lbs) and honestly the price was about 1/3 of what I expected, as it has outlasted way pricier jackets (Carhartt).  Only improvement would be a zipper pocket on the inside since slash pockets have a habit of spilling my phone but I can work around that. Redd Kap has gained a faithful fan, may not buy too much since they last so long, but will recommend to anyone anytime. Heck, look at the photos, blue is 7 years old and grey is my new one. Almost no difference after A LOT of use.

    The best thing about this jacket: Not bulky but warm and the fit.Worn this two weeks straight now.  I am 6' 6"" and have always needed an extra large to get the sleeves to be long enough but in reality, I would take a large.  So I ordered a Large Tall and it fits perfectly.Warmer than your lighter windbreaker jackets but not heavy like your snow jacket.  Light but warm.  I was at a gas station getting gas on a windy night and was surprised at how I did not feel the chill on my upper body.There is one thing I don't care for but not a deal breaker for me. The cuffs have buttons but I don't use them as even the one that has the largest opening, I can't slide my hand through (I would have to unbutton every time to take off).  So I just leave it unbuttoned.

    So i bought this and returned the dickies version bec. this one has two buttons on the sleeve cuff.  Unfortunately the bottom hem of the jacket - waistline is too tight.  Its bec. the design of the jacket is sort of V shape.  It tapers in the lower half portion of the jacket.  Otherwise it would’ve been perfect.

    I was looking for a jacket that was semi casual to wear just about everywhere in Southern California and this jacket is perfect. The cut looks great, I am a little chunky right now so how it cuts in at the waist is perfect for hiding the gut. It is lose enough to easily move around in and be active if needed, I was a little afraid of it being too ""work"" looking, but it is not, looks great out to dinner or for hitting the beach on a walk. Warm, but not too warm.

    I bought this jacket as a replacement for the one I already had that happened to be appx 20 years old. The older one is far better quality, but this is an acceptable replacement. The color is nice too. I don't think it will hold up as well as my old jacket but it keeps me warm and is comfortable, which I suppose is all I can ask for in a jacket. Even though I bought the same size the newer one runs far bigger than the older one, the sleeves are looser around the upper arm and the chest is way puffier. The outside material is the same, but the lining is different and seems easier to tear. Overall I give this a 7/10

    Pros: the green color is very nice, darker than pictured- more like a forest/teal green. The canvas material is water resistant and sulfur Day. The quilted inside is super warm, perfect fall jacket. Jacket sits just below the waist which gives a nice cropped look.Cons: the sleeves are massive. Like almost comedically big. But that said it allows for a lot of flexibility when working/moving. There were also a lot of loose threads all around the jacket. Not surprising given the price and it’s easy enough to go around it with scissors to clean it up.Way cheaper than Dickie’s Eisenhower and maybe only 0.5 lower on the quality scale. Not much to lose since it’s only $40Sizing: 5’ 10”- bought a medium

    I am very familiar with the Dickies equivalent of this Red Kap jacket and this cannot in any way compare to Dickies. Sure it cost less but you get what you pay for. The material is thinner with sloppier stitching( they have even inserted wiry collar stiffeners to try to compensate!) Mine came bagged but had been laundered with pulling and stains on the collar as well as a scent. Yes it fits but this is truly one of my worst Amazon experiences. I would rate it of the quality of iron curtain surplus. Thank you, Prime!
